5,Python 3 Programming Specialization,5,"This specialization teaches the fundamentals of programming in Python 3. We will begin at the beginning, with variables, conditionals, and loops, and get to some intermediate material like keyword parameters, list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and class inheritance.You will have lots of opportunities to practice. You will also learn ways to reason about program execution, so that it is no longer mysterious and you are able to debug programs when they donât work.

By the end of the specialization, youâll be writing programs that query Internet APIs for data and extract useful information from them. And youâll be able to learn to use new modules and APIs on your own by reading the documentation. That will give you a great launch toward being an independent Python programmer.

This specialization is a good next step for you if you have completed Python for Everybody but want a more in-depth treatment of Python fundamentals and more practice, so that you can proceed with confidence to specializations like Applied Data Science with Python.

93,Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization,3,"For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how itâs used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.

The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.

The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.

At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.",Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning

96,Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Finance Specialization,4,"The main goal of this specialization is to provide the knowledge and practical skills necessary to develop a strong foundation on core paradigms and algorithms of machine learning (ML), with a particular focus on applications of ML to various practical problems in Finance.The specialization aims at helping students to be able to solve practical ML-amenable problems that they may encounter in real life that include:

(1) mapping the problem on a general landscape of available ML methods,

(2) choosing particular ML approach(es) that would be most appropriate for resolving the problem, and

(3) successfully implementing a solution, and assessing its performance.

The specialization is designed for three categories of students:

Â· Practitioners working at financial institutions such as banks, asset management firms or hedge funds

Â· Individuals interested in applications of ML for personal day trading

Â· Current full-time students pursuing a degree in Finance, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Engineering or other related disciplines who want to learn about practical applications of ML in Finance.
