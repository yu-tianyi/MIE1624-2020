0,Chapter One - Why we Program?,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the ""Using Python in this Class"" material for details."
1,Installing and Using Python,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In the first chapter we try to cover the ""big picture"" of programming so you get a ""table of contents"" of the rest of the book.   Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it.   This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in.  You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters."
2,Chapter One: Why We Program (continued),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information."
3,Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.  It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes ""choices""."
4,Chapter Three: Conditional Code,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"This is a relatively short chapter.   We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code."
5,Chapter Four: Functions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.  Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over.   Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.
6,Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future."
7,Chapter Six: Strings,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.

8,Unit: Installing and Using Python,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"Up to now, we have been working with data that is read from the user or data in constants.   But real programs process much larger amounts of data by reading and writing files on the secondary storage on your computer.   In this chapter we start to write our first programs that read, scan, and process real data.  "
9,Chapter Seven: Files,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables.  Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable.  Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.  We call these multi-valued variables ""collections"" or ""data structures""."
10,Chapter Eight: Lists,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures.  Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs.  Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory ""database"" in a single Python variable."
11,Chapter Nine: Dictionaries,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure.  Tuples are a simple version of lists.  We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.

346,Welcome,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Our course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data.  This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"".<p> In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent.  Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions.  You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations.<p> You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house."
347,Simple Linear Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"The next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions.  <p> More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price').  This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value.  You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms').  You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"".   Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. <p>Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model."
348,Multiple Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Having learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data.  You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing.  <p> This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment.  You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error.  For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance.  This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning.  Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. <p>The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course."
349,Assessing Performance,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"You have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data.   In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue.  This method is called ""ridge regression"".  You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions.  To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective.  You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression.  To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". <p>You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant."
350,Ridge Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"A fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model.  In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions. <p> To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features.  You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms.  Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge.  This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. <p>Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning. "
351,Feature Selection & Lasso,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Up to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset.  In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods.  These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations.  <p> We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set.  This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors.  Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression.  Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point.  You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle.  You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior."
352,Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.  We also briefly discuss some important regression techniques we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.  "

354,Welcome!,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Linear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods. For example, in our sentiment analysis case-study, a linear classifier associates a coefficient with the counts of each word in the sentence. In this module, you will become proficient in this type of representation. You will focus on a particularly useful type of linear classifier called logistic regression, which, in addition to allowing you to predict a class, provides a probability associated with the prediction. These probabilities are extremely useful, since they provide a degree of confidence in the predictions. In this module, you will also be able to construct features from categorical inputs, and to tackle classification problems with more than two class (multiclass problems). You will examine the results of these techniques on a real-world product sentiment analysis task."
355,Linear Classifiers & Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Once familiar with linear classifiers and logistic regression, you can now dive in and write your first learning algorithm for classification. In particular, you will use gradient ascent to learn the coefficients of your classifier from data. You first will need to define the quality metric for these tasks using an approach called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). You will also become familiar with a simple technique for selecting the step size for gradient ascent. An optional, advanced part of this module will cover the derivation of the gradient for logistic regression.  You will implement your own learning algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and use it to learn a sentiment analysis classifier."
356,Learning Linear Classifiers,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"As we saw in the regression course, overfitting is perhaps the most significant challenge you will face as you apply machine learning approaches in practice. This challenge can be particularly significant for logistic regression, as you will discover in this module, since we not only risk getting an overly complex decision boundary, but your classifier can also become overly confident about the probabilities it predicts. In this module, you will investigate overfitting in classification in significant detail, and obtain broad practical insights from some interesting visualizations of the classifiers' outputs. You will then add a regularization term to your optimization to mitigate overfitting. You will investigate both L2 regularization to penalize large coefficient values, and L1 regularization to obtain additional sparsity in the coefficients. Finally, you will modify your gradient ascent algorithm to learn regularized logistic regression classifiers. You will implement your own regularized logistic regression classifier from scratch, and investigate the impact of the L2 penalty on real-world sentiment analysis data."
357,Overfitting & Regularization in Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Along with linear classifiers, decision trees are amongst the most widely used classification techniques in the real world. This method is extremely intuitive, simple to implement and provides interpretable predictions. In this module, you will become familiar with the core decision trees representation. You will then design a simple, recursive greedy algorithm to learn decision trees from data. Finally, you will extend this approach to deal with continuous inputs, a fundamental requirement for practical problems. In this module, you will investigate a brand new case-study in the financial sector: predicting the risk associated with a bank loan. You will implement your own decision tree learning algorithm on real loan data."
358,Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Out of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. No practical implementation is possible without including approaches that mitigate this challenge. In this module, through various visualizations and investigations, you will investigate why decision trees suffer from significant overfitting problems. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees. At first, you will design algorithms that stop the learning process before the decision trees become overly complex. In an optional segment, you will design a very practical approach that learns an overly-complex tree, and then simplifies it with pruning. Your implementation will investigate the effect of these techniques on mitigating overfitting on our real-world loan data set. "
359,Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Real-world machine learning problems are fraught with missing data. That is, very often, some of the inputs are not observed for all data points. This challenge is very significant, happens in most cases, and needs to be addressed carefully to obtain great performance. And, this issue is rarely discussed in machine learning courses. In this module, you will tackle the missing data challenge head on. You will start with the two most basic techniques to convert a dataset with missing data into a clean dataset, namely skipping missing values and inputing missing values. In an advanced section, you will also design a modification of the decision tree learning algorithm that builds decisions about missing data right into the model. You will also explore these techniques in your real-data implementation.  "
360,Handling Missing Data,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"One of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting, one of the most important and practical techniques in machine learning today. This simple approach can boost the accuracy of any classifier, and is widely used in practice, e.g., it's used by more than half of the teams who win the Kaggle machine learning competitions. In this module, you will first define the ensemble classifier, where multiple models vote on the best prediction. You will then explore a boosting algorithm called  AdaBoost, which provides a great approach for boosting classifiers. Through visualizations, you will become familiar with many of the practical aspects of this techniques. You will create your very own implementation of AdaBoost, from scratch, and use it to boost the performance of your loan risk predictor on real data. "
361,Boosting,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"In many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. You will explore a case-study that significantly highlights this issue: using sentiment analysis to display positive reviews on a restaurant website. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers. You will explore how the probabilities output by your classifier can be used to trade-off precision with recall, and dive into this spectrum, using precision-recall curves. In your hands-on implementation, you will compute these metrics with your learned classifier on real-world sentiment analysis data."
362,Precision-Recall,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"With the advent of the internet, the growth of social media, and the embedding of sensors in the world, the magnitudes of data that our machine learning algorithms must handle have grown tremendously over the last decade. This effect is sometimes called ""Big Data"". Thus, our learning algorithms must scale to bigger and bigger datasets. In this module, you will develop a small modification of gradient ascent called stochastic gradient, which provides significant speedups in the running time of our algorithms. This simple change can drastically improve scaling, but makes the algorithm less stable and harder to use in practice. In this module, you will investigate the practical techniques needed to make stochastic gradient viable, and to thus to obtain learning algorithms that scale to huge datasets. You will also address a new kind of machine learning problem, online learning, where the data streams in over time, and we must learn the coefficients as the data arrives. This task can also be solved with stochastic gradient. You will implement your very own stochastic gradient ascent algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and evaluate it on sentiment analysis data. "

364,Welcome,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"We start the course by considering a retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading.  We cast this problem as one of nearest neighbor search, which is a concept we have seen in the Foundations and Regression courses.  However, here, you will take a deep dive into two critical components of the algorithms: the data representation and metric for measuring similarity between pairs of datapoints.  You will examine the computational burden of the naive nearest neighbor search algorithm, and instead implement scalable alternatives using KD-trees for handling large datasets and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for providing approximate nearest neighbors, even in high-dimensional spaces.  You will explore all of these ideas on a Wikipedia dataset, comparing and contrasting the impact of the various choices you can make on the nearest neighbor results produced."
365,Nearest Neighbor Search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets.  Motivated by our document analysis case study, you will use clustering to discover thematic groups of articles by ""topic"".  These topics are not provided in this unsupervised learning task; rather, the idea is to output such cluster labels that can be post-facto associated with known topics like ""Science"", ""World News"", etc.  Even without such post-facto labels, you will examine how the clustering output can provide insights into the relationships between datapoints in the dataset.  The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there.  To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework.  You will show that k-means can provide an interpretable grouping of Wikipedia articles when appropriately tuned."
366,Clustering with k-means,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information.  In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a ""cluster"" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via ""soft assignments"".  You will explore and implement a broadly useful algorithm called expectation maximization (EM) for inferring these soft assignments, as well as the model parameters.  To gain intuition, you will first consider a visually appealing image clustering task.  You will then cluster Wikipedia articles, handling the high-dimensionality of the tf-idf document representation considered."
367,Mixture Models,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"The clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic.  But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics.  In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis.  You will interpret the output of LDA, and various ways the output can be utilized, like as a set of learned document features.  The mixed membership modeling ideas you learn about through LDA for document analysis carry over to many other interesting models and applications, like social network models where people have multiple affiliations.<p>Throughout this module, we introduce aspects of Bayesian modeling and a Bayesian inference algorithm called Gibbs sampling.  You will be able to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA by the end of the module."
368,Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.<p>We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset.  Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series.  We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.

383,Consumption,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-asset-management-alternative-data,"Module 2 is an introduction to text mining as well as a demonstration of how to get from data retrieval (web scraping) to financial market insights. Some of the classic text mining methodologies are covered such as vectorization of text (the bag of words approach), stop words for filtering, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Students will learn how text can be mathematically represented, and regularized/filtered to reduce noise. Measures of text-similarity will be covered in theoretical and practice sessions. Lab sessions go through examples of web scraping data, regularizing with the described techniques and finally, insights will be derived from the textual data."
384,Textual Analysis for Financial Applications,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-asset-management-alternative-data,"Module 3 is a practical extension of the text mining lessons to 10-K and 13-F, two of the most commonly researched corporate filings. This type of data can be extremely daunting when used by individual analysts due to the sheer size of the documents, but module 3 describes the methodologies for quantitatively analyzing these documents with Python code. Both the 10-K and 13-F documents are worked through, and within the lab sessions it is demonstrated how one can automatically pull this kind of data as well as define metrics around them. We investigate implementations of research in this field around similarity of given companies 10-K statements over time as well as similarity between fund holdings from the 13-F in the lab."
385,Processing Corporate Filings,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-asset-management-alternative-data,"The final module introduces both sentiment analysis in the context of textual data as well as network analysis in the context of connectivity of firms. Sentiment analysis is an avenue of potentially fruitful information that when done correctly can display what a general population might believe about a company (through for example social media) or even whether the company itself is positive or negative on future outlook (through analysis of tone in corporate filings). Network analysis, as shown in the research of course instructors and his colleagues, can be used to accurately capture how a financial network is oriented and what companies might perform well because of other firm’s mentioning them as a threat. The lab session of this module extends the corporate filings analysis to examine sentiment while also introducing a set of tweets which are then transformed into a network representation."

387,Selecting a research question,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will discuss how to write a basic program that allows you to load a data set and examine frequency distributions. Your task will be to write a program that helps you to explore the variables you have selected for your own research question. You may choose either Python or SAS. Both are made freely available, and we have created a helpful guide to support you in making the decision. Once you have selected your platform, just follow the instructions in the appropriate ""GETTING STARTED...."" file, and then check out this week's video lessons aimed at helping you write and run your first program. You need only view the lessons for one of the statistical platforms (SAS or Python)."
388,Writing your first program - SAS or Python,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will help you to make and implement even more decisions with data. Statisticians often call this task 'data management', while computer scientists like the term 'data munging'. Whatever you call it, it is a vital and ongoing process when working with data. Your task will be to write a program that manages the variables you have selected for your own research question. "

In statistics, moderation occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. The effect of a moderating variable is often characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a third variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between your explanatory (X) and response (Y) variable. Your task will be to test your own research question in the context of one or more potential moderating variables. "

396,Introduction to Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we discuss more about the importance of testing for confounding, and provide examples of situations in which a confounding variable can explain the association between an explanatory and response variable. In addition, now that you have statistically tested the association between an explanatory variable and your response variable, you will test and interpret this association using basic linear regression analysis for a quantitative response variable. You will also learn about how the linear regression model can be used to predict your observed response variable. Finally, we will also discuss the statistical assumptions underlying the linear regression model, and show you some best practices for coding your explanatory variablesNote that if your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use one from your data set just to get some practice with the tool."
397,Basics of Linear Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"Multiple regression analysis is tool that allows you to expand on your research question, and conduct a more rigorous test of the association between your explanatory and response variable by adding additional quantitative and/or categorical explanatory variables to your linear regression model. In this session, you will apply and interpret a multiple regression analysis for a quantitative response variable, and will learn how to use confidence intervals to take into account error in estimating a population parameter. You will also learn how to account for nonlinear associations in a linear regression model. Finally, you will develop experience using regression diagnostic techniques to evaluate how well your multiple regression model predicts your observed response variable. Note that if you have not yet identified additional explanatory variables, you should choose at least one additional explanatory variable from your data set. When you go back to your codebooks, ask yourself a few questions like “What other variables might explain the association between my explanatory and response variable?”; “What other variables might explain more of the variability in my response variable?”, or even “What other explanatory variables might be interesting to explore?” Additional explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical, or both. Although you need only two explanatory variables to test a multiple regression model, we encourage you to identify more than one additional explanatory variable. Doing so will really allow you to experience the power of multiple regression analysis, and will increase your confidence in your ability to test and interpret more complex regression models. If your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use the same quantitative response variable that you used in Module 2, or you may choose another one from your data set."
398,Multiple Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will discuss some things that you should keep in mind as you continue to use data analysis in the future. We will also teach also you how to test a categorical explanatory variable with more than two categories in a multiple regression analysis. Finally, we introduce you to logistic regression analysis for a binary response variable with multiple explanatory variables. Logistic regression is simply another form of the linear regression model, so the basic idea is the same as a multiple regression analysis. But, unlike the multiple regression model, the logistic regression model is designed to test binary response variables. You will gain experience testing and interpreting a logistic regression model, including using odds ratios and confidence intervals to determine the magnitude of the association between your explanatory variables and response variable.   You can use the same explanatory variables that you used to test your multiple regression model with a quantitative outcome, but your response variable needs to be binary (categorical with 2 categories). If you have a quantitative response variable, you will have to bin it into 2 categories. Alternatively, you can choose a different binary response variable from your data set that you can use to test a logistic regression model. If you have a categorical response variable with more than two categories, you will need to collapse it into two categories."
399,Logistic Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"At Wesleyan, distinguished scholar-teachers work closely with students, taking advantage of fluidity among disciplines to explore the world with a variety of tools. The university seeks to build a diverse, energetic community of students, faculty, and staff who think critically and creatively and who value independence of mind and generosity of spirit."
400,Decision Trees,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, you will learn about random forests, a type of data mining algorithm that can select from among a large number of variables those that are most important in determining the target or response variable to be explained. Unlike decision trees, the results of random forests generalize well to new data."
401,Random Forests,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"Lasso regression analysis is a shrinkage and variable selection method for linear regression models. The goal of lasso regression is to obtain the subset of predictors that minimizes prediction error for a quantitative response variable. The lasso does this by imposing a constraint on the model parameters that causes regression coefficients for some variables to shrink toward zero. Variables with a regression coefficient equal to zero after the shrinkage process are excluded from the model. Variables with non-zero regression coefficients variables are most strongly associated with the response variable. Explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical or both. In this session, you will apply and interpret a lasso regression analysis. You will also develop experience using k-fold cross validation to select the best fitting model and obtain a more accurate estimate of your model’s test error rate. To test a lasso regression model, you will need to identify a quantitative response variable from your data set if you haven’t already done so, and choose a few additional quantitative and categorical predictor (i.e. explanatory) variables to develop a larger pool of predictors.  Having a larger pool of predictors to test will maximize your experience with lasso regression analysis. Remember that lasso regression is a machine learning method, so your choice of additional predictors does not necessarily need to depend on a research hypothesis or theory. Take some chances, and try some new variables. The lasso regression analysis will help you determine which of your predictors are most important. Note also that if you are working with a relatively small data set, you do not need to split your data into training and test data sets. The cross-validation method you apply is designed to eliminate the need to split your data when you have a limited number of observations."
402,Lasso Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning method that partitions the observations in a data set into a smaller set of clusters where each observation belongs to only one cluster. The goal of cluster analysis is to group, or cluster, observations into subsets based on their similarity of responses on multiple variables. Clustering variables should be primarily quantitative variables, but binary variables may also be included. In this session, we will show you how to use k-means cluster analysis to identify clusters of observations in your data set. You will gain experience in interpreting cluster analysis results by using graphing methods to help you determine the number of clusters to interpret, and examining clustering variable means to evaluate the cluster profiles. Finally, you will get the opportunity to validate your cluster solution by examining differences between clusters on a variable not included in your cluster analysis.  You can use the same variables that you have used in past weeks as clustering variables. If most or all of your previous explanatory variables are categorical, you should identify some additional quantitative clustering variables from your data set. Ideally, most of your clustering variables will be quantitative, although you may also include some binary variables. In addition, you will need to identify a quantitative or binary response variable from your data set that you will not include in your cluster analysis. You will use this variable to validate your clusters by evaluating whether your clusters differ significantly on this response variable using statistical methods, such as analysis of variance or chi-square analysis, which you learned about in Course 2 of the specialization (Data Analysis Tools). Note also that if you are working with a relatively small data set, you do not need to split your data into training and test data sets."

440,Introduction to Linear Algebra and to Mathematics for Machine Learning,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"In this module, we look at operations we can do with vectors - finding the modulus (size), angle between vectors (dot or inner product) and projections of one vector onto another. We can then examine how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes - the basis.

Then we look at how to solve systems of linear equations using matrices, which will then take us on to look at inverse matrices and determinants, and to think about what the determinant really is, intuitively speaking. Finally, we'll look at cases of special matrices that mean that the determinant is zero or where the matrix isn't invertible - cases where algorithms that need to invert a matrix will fail."
442,Matrices in Linear Algebra: Objects that operate on Vectors,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"In Module 4, we continue our discussion of matrices; first we think about how to code up matrix multiplication and matrix operations using the Einstein Summation Convention, which is a widely used notation in more advanced linear algebra courses. Then, we look at how matrices can transform a description of a vector from one basis (set of axes) to another. This will allow us to, for example, figure out how to apply a reflection to an image and manipulate images. We'll also look at how to construct a convenient basis vector set in order to do such transformations. Then, we'll write some code to do these transformations and apply this work computationally."
443,Matrices make linear mappings,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"Eigenvectors are particular vectors that are unrotated by a transformation matrix, and eigenvalues are the amount by which the eigenvectors are stretched. These special 'eigen-things' are very useful in linear algebra and will let us examine Google's famous PageRank algorithm for presenting web search results. Then we'll apply this in code, which will wrap up the course."

445,What is calculus?,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Building on the foundations of the previous module, we now generalise our calculus tools to handle multivariable systems. This means we can take a function with multiple inputs and determine the influence of each of them separately. It would not be unusual for a machine learning method to require the analysis of a function with thousands of inputs, so we will also introduce the linear algebra structures necessary for storing the results of our multivariate calculus analysis in an orderly fashion.  "
446,Multivariate calculus,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Having seen that multivariate calculus is really no more complicated than the univariate case, we now focus on applications of the chain rule. Neural networks are one of the most popular and successful conceptual structures in machine learning. They are build up from a connected web of neurons and inspired by the structure of biological brains. The behaviour of each neuron is influenced by a set of control parameters, each of which needs to be optimised to best fit the data. The multivariate chain rule can be used to calculate the influence of each parameter of the networks, allow them to be updated during training. "
447,Multivariate chain rule and its applications,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"The Taylor series is a method for re-expressing functions as polynomial series. This approach is the rational behind the use of simple linear approximations to complicated functions. In this module, we will derive the formal expression for the univariate Taylor series and discuss some important consequences of this result relevant to machine learning. Finally, we will discuss the multivariate case and see how the Jacobian and the Hessian come in to play. "
448,Taylor series and linearisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"If we want to find the minimum and maximum points of a function then we can use multivariate calculus to do this, say to optimise the parameters  (the space) of a function to fit some data.  First we’ll do this in one dimension and use the gradient to give us estimates of where the zero points of that function are, and then iterate in the Newton-Raphson method.  Then we’ll extend the idea to multiple dimensions by finding the gradient vector, Grad, which is the vector of the Jacobian.  This will then let us find our way to the minima and maxima in what is called the gradient descent method.  We’ll then take a moment to use Grad to find the minima and maxima along a constraint in the space, which is the Lagrange multipliers method."
449,Intro to optimisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"In order to optimise the fitting parameters of a fitting function to the best fit for some data, we need a way to define how good our fit is.  This goodness of fit is called chi-squared, which we’ll first apply to fitting a straight line - linear regression.  Then we’ll look at how to optimise our fitting function using chi-squared in the general case using the gradient descent method. Finally, we’ll look at how to do this easily in Python in just a few lines of code, which will wrap up the course."

451,Statistics of Datasets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"Data can be interpreted as vectors. Vectors allow us to talk about geometric concepts, such as lengths, distances and angles to characterise similarity between vectors. This will become important later in the course when we discuss PCA. In this module, we will introduce and practice the concept of an inner product. Inner products allow us to talk about geometric concepts in vector spaces. More specifically, we will start with the dot product (which we may still know from school) as a special case of an inner product, and then move toward a more general concept of an inner product, which play an integral part in some areas of machine learning, such as kernel machines (this includes support vector machines and Gaussian processes). We have a lot of exercises in this module to practice and understand the concept of inner products."
452,Inner Products,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"In this module, we will look at orthogonal projections of vectors, which live in a high-dimensional vector space, onto lower-dimensional subspaces. This will play an important role in the next module when we derive PCA. We will start off with a geometric motivation of what an orthogonal projection is and work our way through the corresponding derivation. We will end up with a single equation that allows us to project any vector onto a lower-dimensional subspace. However, we will also understand how this equation came about. As in the other modules, we will have both pen-and-paper practice and a small programming example with a jupyter notebook."
453,Orthogonal Projections,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"We can think of dimensionality reduction as a way of compressing data with some loss, similar to jpg or mp3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental dimensionality reduction techniques that are used in machine learning. In this module, we use the results from the first three modules of this course and derive PCA from a geometric point of view. Within this course, this module is the most challenging one, and we will go through an explicit derivation of PCA plus some coding exercises that will make us a proficient user of PCA. "
