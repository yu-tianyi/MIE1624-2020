59,Welcome,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Our course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data.  This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"".<p> In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent.  Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions.  You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations.<p> You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house."
60,Simple Linear Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"The next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions.  <p> More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price').  This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value.  You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms').  You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"".   Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. <p>Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model."
61,Multiple Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Having learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data.  You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing.  <p> This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment.  You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error.  For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance.  This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning.  Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. <p>The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course."
62,Assessing Performance,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"You have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data.   In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue.  This method is called ""ridge regression"".  You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions.  To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective.  You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression.  To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". <p>You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant."
63,Ridge Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"A fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model.  In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions. <p> To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features.  You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms.  Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge.  This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. <p>Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning. "
64,Feature Selection & Lasso,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Up to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset.  In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods.  These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations.  <p> We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set.  This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors.  Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression.  Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point.  You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle.  You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior."
65,Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.  We also briefly discuss some important regression techniques we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.  "
66,Closing Remarks,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world."
67,Welcome!,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Linear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods. For example, in our sentiment analysis case-study, a linear classifier associates a coefficient with the counts of each word in the sentence. In this module, you will become proficient in this type of representation. You will focus on a particularly useful type of linear classifier called logistic regression, which, in addition to allowing you to predict a class, provides a probability associated with the prediction. These probabilities are extremely useful, since they provide a degree of confidence in the predictions. In this module, you will also be able to construct features from categorical inputs, and to tackle classification problems with more than two class (multiclass problems). You will examine the results of these techniques on a real-world product sentiment analysis task."
68,Linear Classifiers & Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Once familiar with linear classifiers and logistic regression, you can now dive in and write your first learning algorithm for classification. In particular, you will use gradient ascent to learn the coefficients of your classifier from data. You first will need to define the quality metric for these tasks using an approach called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). You will also become familiar with a simple technique for selecting the step size for gradient ascent. An optional, advanced part of this module will cover the derivation of the gradient for logistic regression.  You will implement your own learning algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and use it to learn a sentiment analysis classifier."
69,Learning Linear Classifiers,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"As we saw in the regression course, overfitting is perhaps the most significant challenge you will face as you apply machine learning approaches in practice. This challenge can be particularly significant for logistic regression, as you will discover in this module, since we not only risk getting an overly complex decision boundary, but your classifier can also become overly confident about the probabilities it predicts. In this module, you will investigate overfitting in classification in significant detail, and obtain broad practical insights from some interesting visualizations of the classifiers' outputs. You will then add a regularization term to your optimization to mitigate overfitting. You will investigate both L2 regularization to penalize large coefficient values, and L1 regularization to obtain additional sparsity in the coefficients. Finally, you will modify your gradient ascent algorithm to learn regularized logistic regression classifiers. You will implement your own regularized logistic regression classifier from scratch, and investigate the impact of the L2 penalty on real-world sentiment analysis data."
70,Overfitting & Regularization in Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Along with linear classifiers, decision trees are amongst the most widely used classification techniques in the real world. This method is extremely intuitive, simple to implement and provides interpretable predictions. In this module, you will become familiar with the core decision trees representation. You will then design a simple, recursive greedy algorithm to learn decision trees from data. Finally, you will extend this approach to deal with continuous inputs, a fundamental requirement for practical problems. In this module, you will investigate a brand new case-study in the financial sector: predicting the risk associated with a bank loan. You will implement your own decision tree learning algorithm on real loan data."
71,Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Out of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. No practical implementation is possible without including approaches that mitigate this challenge. In this module, through various visualizations and investigations, you will investigate why decision trees suffer from significant overfitting problems. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees. At first, you will design algorithms that stop the learning process before the decision trees become overly complex. In an optional segment, you will design a very practical approach that learns an overly-complex tree, and then simplifies it with pruning. Your implementation will investigate the effect of these techniques on mitigating overfitting on our real-world loan data set. "
72,Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Real-world machine learning problems are fraught with missing data. That is, very often, some of the inputs are not observed for all data points. This challenge is very significant, happens in most cases, and needs to be addressed carefully to obtain great performance. And, this issue is rarely discussed in machine learning courses. In this module, you will tackle the missing data challenge head on. You will start with the two most basic techniques to convert a dataset with missing data into a clean dataset, namely skipping missing values and inputing missing values. In an advanced section, you will also design a modification of the decision tree learning algorithm that builds decisions about missing data right into the model. You will also explore these techniques in your real-data implementation.  "
73,Handling Missing Data,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"One of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting, one of the most important and practical techniques in machine learning today. This simple approach can boost the accuracy of any classifier, and is widely used in practice, e.g., it's used by more than half of the teams who win the Kaggle machine learning competitions. In this module, you will first define the ensemble classifier, where multiple models vote on the best prediction. You will then explore a boosting algorithm called  AdaBoost, which provides a great approach for boosting classifiers. Through visualizations, you will become familiar with many of the practical aspects of this techniques. You will create your very own implementation of AdaBoost, from scratch, and use it to boost the performance of your loan risk predictor on real data. "
74,Boosting,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"In many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. You will explore a case-study that significantly highlights this issue: using sentiment analysis to display positive reviews on a restaurant website. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers. You will explore how the probabilities output by your classifier can be used to trade-off precision with recall, and dive into this spectrum, using precision-recall curves. In your hands-on implementation, you will compute these metrics with your learned classifier on real-world sentiment analysis data."
75,Precision-Recall,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"With the advent of the internet, the growth of social media, and the embedding of sensors in the world, the magnitudes of data that our machine learning algorithms must handle have grown tremendously over the last decade. This effect is sometimes called ""Big Data"". Thus, our learning algorithms must scale to bigger and bigger datasets. In this module, you will develop a small modification of gradient ascent called stochastic gradient, which provides significant speedups in the running time of our algorithms. This simple change can drastically improve scaling, but makes the algorithm less stable and harder to use in practice. In this module, you will investigate the practical techniques needed to make stochastic gradient viable, and to thus to obtain learning algorithms that scale to huge datasets. You will also address a new kind of machine learning problem, online learning, where the data streams in over time, and we must learn the coefficients as the data arrives. This task can also be solved with stochastic gradient. You will implement your very own stochastic gradient ascent algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and evaluate it on sentiment analysis data. "
76,Scaling to Huge Datasets & Online Learning,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world."
77,Welcome,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"We start the course by considering a retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading.  We cast this problem as one of nearest neighbor search, which is a concept we have seen in the Foundations and Regression courses.  However, here, you will take a deep dive into two critical components of the algorithms: the data representation and metric for measuring similarity between pairs of datapoints.  You will examine the computational burden of the naive nearest neighbor search algorithm, and instead implement scalable alternatives using KD-trees for handling large datasets and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for providing approximate nearest neighbors, even in high-dimensional spaces.  You will explore all of these ideas on a Wikipedia dataset, comparing and contrasting the impact of the various choices you can make on the nearest neighbor results produced."
78,Nearest Neighbor Search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets.  Motivated by our document analysis case study, you will use clustering to discover thematic groups of articles by ""topic"".  These topics are not provided in this unsupervised learning task; rather, the idea is to output such cluster labels that can be post-facto associated with known topics like ""Science"", ""World News"", etc.  Even without such post-facto labels, you will examine how the clustering output can provide insights into the relationships between datapoints in the dataset.  The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there.  To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework.  You will show that k-means can provide an interpretable grouping of Wikipedia articles when appropriately tuned."
79,Clustering with k-means,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information.  In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a ""cluster"" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via ""soft assignments"".  You will explore and implement a broadly useful algorithm called expectation maximization (EM) for inferring these soft assignments, as well as the model parameters.  To gain intuition, you will first consider a visually appealing image clustering task.  You will then cluster Wikipedia articles, handling the high-dimensionality of the tf-idf document representation considered."
80,Mixture Models,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"The clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic.  But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics.  In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis.  You will interpret the output of LDA, and various ways the output can be utilized, like as a set of learned document features.  The mixed membership modeling ideas you learn about through LDA for document analysis carry over to many other interesting models and applications, like social network models where people have multiple affiliations.<p>Throughout this module, we introduce aspects of Bayesian modeling and a Bayesian inference algorithm called Gibbs sampling.  You will be able to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA by the end of the module."
81,Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.<p>We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset.  Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series.  We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.  "

83,Welcome to the Course! ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning,"When you’re presented with a problem in industry, the first and most important step is to translate that problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The quality of your solution depends heavily on how well you do this translation. This week, you will learn the definition of MDPs, you will understand goal-directed behavior and how this can be obtained from maximizing scalar rewards, and you will also understand the difference between episodic and continuing tasks. For this week’s graded assessment, you will create three example tasks of your own that fit into the MDP framework. "

For this week’s graded assessment, you will implement an efficient dynamic programming agent in a simulated industrial control problem."

88,Welcome to the Course! ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"This week, you will learn about one of the most fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning: temporal difference (TD) learning. TD learning combines some of the features of both Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. TD methods are similar to Monte Carlo methods in that they can learn from the agent’s interaction with the world, and do not require knowledge of the model. TD methods are similar to DP methods in that they bootstrap, and thus can learn online---no waiting until the end of an episode. You will see how TD can learn more efficiently than Monte Carlo, due to bootstrapping. For this module, we first focus on TD for prediction, and discuss TD for control in the next module. This week, you will implement TD to estimate the value function for a fixed policy, in a simulated domain. "
89, Monte Carlo Methods for Prediction & Control,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"This week, you will learn about using temporal difference learning for control, as a generalized policy iteration strategy.

You will see some of the differences between the methods for on-policy and off-policy control, and that Expected Sarsa is a unified algorithm for both. You will implement Expected Sarsa and Q-learning, on Cliff World. "
90,Temporal Difference Learning Methods for Prediction ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"Up until now, you might think that learning with and without a model are two distinct, and in some ways, competing strategies: planning with Dynamic Programming verses sample-based learning via TD methods. This week we unify these two strategies with the Dyna architecture. You will learn how to estimate the model from data and then use this model to generate hypothetical experience (a bit like dreaming) to dramatically improve sample efficiency compared to sample-based methods like Q-learning. In addition, you will learn how to design learning systems that are robust to inaccurate models. "

93,Welcome to the Course!,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation,"The features used to construct the agent’s value estimates are perhaps the most crucial part of a successful learning system. In this module we discuss two basic strategies for constructing features: (1) fixed basis that form an exhaustive partition of the input, and (2) adapting the features while the agent interacts with the world via Neural Networks and Backpropagation. In this week’s graded assessment you will solve a simple but infinite state prediction task with a Neural Network and TD learning.  "
94,On-policy Prediction with Approximation,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation,"This week, you will see that the concepts and tools introduced in modules two and three allow straightforward extension of classic TD control methods to the function approximation setting. In particular, you will learn how to find the optimal policy in infinite-state MDPs by simply combining semi-gradient TD methods with generalized policy iteration, yielding classic control methods like Q-learning, and Sarsa. We conclude with a discussion of a new problem formulation for RL---average reward---which will undoubtedly be used in many applications of RL in the future. "
95,Constructing Features for Prediction,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation,"Every algorithm you have learned about so far estimates a value function as an intermediate step towards the goal of finding an optimal policy. An alternative strategy is to directly learn the parameters of the policy. This week you will learn about these policy gradient methods, and their advantages over value-function based methods. You will also learn how policy gradient methods can be used to find the optimal policy in tasks with both continuous state and action spaces."

185,Welcome,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Our course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data.  This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"".<p> In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent.  Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions.  You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations.<p> You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house."
186,Simple Linear Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"The next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions.  <p> More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price').  This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value.  You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms').  You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"".   Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. <p>Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model."
187,Multiple Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Having learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data.  You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing.  <p> This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment.  You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error.  For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance.  This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning.  Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. <p>The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course."
188,Assessing Performance,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"You have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data.   In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue.  This method is called ""ridge regression"".  You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions.  To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective.  You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression.  To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". <p>You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant."
189,Ridge Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"A fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model.  In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions. <p> To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features.  You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms.  Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge.  This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. <p>Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning. "
190,Feature Selection & Lasso,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Up to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset.  In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods.  These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations.  <p> We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set.  This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors.  Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression.  Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point.  You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle.  You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior."
191,Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.  We also briefly discuss some important regression techniques we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.  "

For example, in our sentiment analysis case-study, a linear classifier associates a coefficient with the counts of each word in the sentence. In this module, you will become proficient in this type of representation. You will focus on a particularly useful type of linear classifier called logistic regression, which, in addition to allowing you to predict a class, provides a probability associated with the prediction. These probabilities are extremely useful, since they provide a degree of confidence in the predictions. In this module, you will also be able to construct features from categorical inputs, and to tackle classification problems with more than two class (multiclass problems). You will examine the results of these techniques on a real-world product sentiment analysis task."
194,Linear Classifiers & Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Once familiar with linear classifiers and logistic regression, you can now dive in and write your first learning algorithm for classification. In particular, you will use gradient ascent to learn the coefficients of your classifier from data. You first will need to define the quality metric for these tasks using an approach called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). You will also become familiar with a simple technique for selecting the step size for gradient ascent. An optional, advanced part of this module will cover the derivation of the gradient for logistic regression.  You will implement your own learning algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and use it to learn a sentiment analysis classifier."
195,Learning Linear Classifiers,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"As we saw in the regression course, overfitting is perhaps the most significant challenge you will face as you apply machine learning approaches in practice. This challenge can be particularly significant for logistic regression, as you will discover in this module, since we not only risk getting an overly complex decision boundary, but your classifier can also become overly confident about the probabilities it predicts. In this module, you will investigate overfitting in classification in significant detail, and obtain broad practical insights from some interesting visualizations of the classifiers' outputs. You will then add a regularization term to your optimization to mitigate overfitting. You will investigate both L2 regularization to penalize large coefficient values, and L1 regularization to obtain additional sparsity in the coefficients. Finally, you will modify your gradient ascent algorithm to learn regularized logistic regression classifiers. You will implement your own regularized logistic regression classifier from scratch, and investigate the impact of the L2 penalty on real-world sentiment analysis data."
196,Overfitting & Regularization in Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Along with linear classifiers, decision trees are amongst the most widely used classification techniques in the real world. This method is extremely intuitive, simple to implement and provides interpretable predictions. In this module, you will become familiar with the core decision trees representation. You will then design a simple, recursive greedy algorithm to learn decision trees from data. Finally, you will extend this approach to deal with continuous inputs, a fundamental requirement for practical problems. In this module, you will investigate a brand new case-study in the financial sector: predicting the risk associated with a bank loan. You will implement your own decision tree learning algorithm on real loan data."
197,Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Out of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. No practical implementation is possible without including approaches that mitigate this challenge. In this module, through various visualizations and investigations, you will investigate why decision trees suffer from significant overfitting problems. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees. At first, you will design algorithms that stop the learning process before the decision trees become overly complex. In an optional segment, you will design a very practical approach that learns an overly-complex tree, and then simplifies it with pruning. Your implementation will investigate the effect of these techniques on mitigating overfitting on our real-world loan data set. "
198,Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Real-world machine learning problems are fraught with missing data. That is, very often, some of the inputs are not observed for all data points. This challenge is very significant, happens in most cases, and needs to be addressed carefully to obtain great performance. And, this issue is rarely discussed in machine learning courses. In this module, you will tackle the missing data challenge head on. You will start with the two most basic techniques to convert a dataset with missing data into a clean dataset, namely skipping missing values and inputing missing values. In an advanced section, you will also design a modification of the decision tree learning algorithm that builds decisions about missing data right into the model. You will also explore these techniques in your real-data implementation.  "
199,Handling Missing Data,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"One of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting, one of the most important and practical techniques in machine learning today. This simple approach can boost the accuracy of any classifier, and is widely used in practice, e.g., it's used by more than half of the teams who win the Kaggle machine learning competitions. In this module, you will first define the ensemble classifier, where multiple models vote on the best prediction. You will then explore a boosting algorithm called  AdaBoost, which provides a great approach for boosting classifiers. Through visualizations, you will become familiar with many of the practical aspects of this techniques. You will create your very own implementation of AdaBoost, from scratch, and use it to boost the performance of your loan risk predictor on real data. "
200,Boosting,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"In many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. You will explore a case-study that significantly highlights this issue: using sentiment analysis to display positive reviews on a restaurant website. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers. You will explore how the probabilities output by your classifier can be used to trade-off precision with recall, and dive into this spectrum, using precision-recall curves. In your hands-on implementation, you will compute these metrics with your learned classifier on real-world sentiment analysis data."
201,Precision-Recall,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"With the advent of the internet, the growth of social media, and the embedding of sensors in the world, the magnitudes of data that our machine learning algorithms must handle have grown tremendously over the last decade. This effect is sometimes called ""Big Data"". Thus, our learning algorithms must scale to bigger and bigger datasets. In this module, you will develop a small modification of gradient ascent called stochastic gradient, which provides significant speedups in the running time of our algorithms. This simple change can drastically improve scaling, but makes the algorithm less stable and harder to use in practice. In this module, you will investigate the practical techniques needed to make stochastic gradient viable, and to thus to obtain learning algorithms that scale to huge datasets. You will also address a new kind of machine learning problem, online learning, where the data streams in over time, and we must learn the coefficients as the data arrives. This task can also be solved with stochastic gradient. You will implement your very own stochastic gradient ascent algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and evaluate it on sentiment analysis data. "
202,Scaling to Huge Datasets & Online Learning,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world."
203,Welcome,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"We start the course by considering a retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading.  We cast this problem as one of nearest neighbor search, which is a concept we have seen in the Foundations and Regression courses.  However, here, you will take a deep dive into two critical components of the algorithms: the data representation and metric for measuring similarity between pairs of datapoints.  You will examine the computational burden of the naive nearest neighbor search algorithm, and instead implement scalable alternatives using KD-trees for handling large datasets and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for providing approximate nearest neighbors, even in high-dimensional spaces.  You will explore all of these ideas on a Wikipedia dataset, comparing and contrasting the impact of the various choices you can make on the nearest neighbor results produced."
204,Nearest Neighbor Search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets.  Motivated by our document analysis case study, you will use clustering to discover thematic groups of articles by ""topic"".  These topics are not provided in this unsupervised learning task; rather, the idea is to output such cluster labels that can be post-facto associated with known topics like ""Science"", ""World News"", etc.  Even without such post-facto labels, you will examine how the clustering output can provide insights into the relationships between datapoints in the dataset.  The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there.  To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework.  You will show that k-means can provide an interpretable grouping of Wikipedia articles when appropriately tuned."
205,Clustering with k-means,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information.  In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a ""cluster"" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via ""soft assignments"".  You will explore and implement a broadly useful algorithm called expectation maximization (EM) for inferring these soft assignments, as well as the model parameters.  To gain intuition, you will first consider a visually appealing image clustering task.  You will then cluster Wikipedia articles, handling the high-dimensionality of the tf-idf document representation considered."
206,Mixture Models,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"The clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic.  But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics.  In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis.  You will interpret the output of LDA, and various ways the output can be utilized, like as a set of learned document features.  The mixed membership modeling ideas you learn about through LDA for document analysis carry over to many other interesting models and applications, like social network models where people have multiple affiliations.<p>Throughout this module, we introduce aspects of Bayesian modeling and a Bayesian inference algorithm called Gibbs sampling.  You will be able to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA by the end of the module."
207,Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.<p>We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset.  Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series.  We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.

209,Welcome to the Course! ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning,"When you’re presented with a problem in industry, the first and most important step is to translate that problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The quality of your solution depends heavily on how well you do this translation. This week, you will learn the definition of MDPs, you will understand goal-directed behavior and how this can be obtained from maximizing scalar rewards, and you will also understand the difference between episodic and continuing tasks.

214,Welcome to the Course! ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"This week, you will learn about one of the most fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning: temporal difference (TD) learning. TD learning combines some of the features of both Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. TD methods are similar to Monte Carlo methods in that they can learn from the agent’s interaction with the world, and do not require knowledge of the model. TD methods are similar to DP methods in that they bootstrap, and thus can learn online---no waiting until the end of an episode. You will see how TD can learn more efficiently than Monte Carlo, due to bootstrapping. For this module, we first focus on TD for prediction, and discuss TD for control in the next module. This week, you will implement TD to estimate the value function for a fixed policy, in a simulated domain. "
215, Monte Carlo Methods for Prediction & Control,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"This week, you will learn about using temporal difference learning for control, as a generalized policy iteration strategy.

You will see some of the differences between the methods for on-policy and off-policy control, and that Expected Sarsa is a unified algorithm for both. You will implement Expected Sarsa and Q-learning, on Cliff World. "
216,Temporal Difference Learning Methods for Prediction ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"Up until now, you might think that learning with and without a model are two distinct, and in some ways, competing strategies: planning with Dynamic Programming verses sample-based learning via TD methods. This week we unify these two strategies with the Dyna architecture. You will learn how to estimate the model from data and then use this model to generate hypothetical experience (a bit like dreaming) to dramatically improve sample efficiency compared to sample-based methods like Q-learning. In addition, you will learn how to design learning systems that are robust to inaccurate models. "

221,Constructing Features for Prediction,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation,"Every algorithm you have learned about so far estimates a value function as an intermediate step towards the goal of finding an optimal policy.

Sentiment analysis is an avenue of potentially fruitful information that when done correctly can display what a general population might believe about a company (through for example social media) or even whether the company itself is positive or negative on future outlook (through analysis of tone in corporate filings). Network analysis, as shown in the research of course instructors and his colleagues, can be used to accurately capture how a financial network is oriented and what companies might perform well because of other firm’s mentioning them as a threat. The lab session of this module extends the corporate filings analysis to examine sentiment while also introducing a set of tweets which are then transformed into a network representation."

605,A New Programming Paradigm,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,Welcome to week 2 of the course! In week 1 you learned all about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning is a new programming paradigm. This week you’re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code! Check out this conversation between Laurence and Andrew where they discuss it and introduce you to Computer Vision!
606,Introduction to Computer Vision,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"Welcome to week 3! In week 2 you saw a basic Neural Network for Computer Vision. It did the job nicely, but it was a little naive in its approach. This week we’ll see how to make it better, as discussed by Laurence and Andrew here. "
607,Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"Last week you saw how to improve the results from your deep neural network using convolutions. It was a good start, but the data you used was very basic. What happens when your images are larger, or if the features aren’t always in the same place? Andrew and Laurence discuss this to prepare you for what you’ll learn this week: handling complex images!"
608,Using Real-world Images,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"deeplearning.ai is Andrew Ng's new venture which amongst others, strives for providing comprehensive AI education beyond borders."
609,Exploring a Larger Dataset,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"You've heard the term overfitting a number of times to this point. Overfitting is simply the concept of being over specialized in training -- namely that your model is very good at classifying what it is trained for, but not so good at classifying things that it hasn't seen. In order to generalize your model more effectively, you will of course need a greater breadth of samples to train it on. That's not always possible, but a nice potential shortcut to this is Image Augmentation, where you tweak the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers. You'll learn all about that this week!"
610,Augmentation: A technique to avoid overfitting,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as you've seen, you can be limited by the data you have on hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively. Transfer learning can help solve this -- where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that you can either use them directly, or, you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario. This is Transfer learning, and you'll look into that this week!"
611,Transfer Learning,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"You've come a long way, Congratulations! One more thing to do before we move off of ConvNets to the next module, and that's to go beyond binary classification. Each of the examples you've done so far involved classifying one thing or another -- horse or human, cat or dog. When moving beyond binary into Categorical classification there are some coding considerations you need to take into account. You'll look at them this week!"
612,Multiclass Classifications,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"deeplearning.ai is Andrew Ng's new venture which amongst others, strives for providing comprehensive AI education beyond borders."
613,Sentiment in text,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"Last week you saw how to use the Tokenizer to prepare your text to be used by a neural network by converting words into numeric tokens, and sequencing sentences from these tokens. This week you'll learn about Embeddings, where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space. With Embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space. This will begin the process of training a neural network to udnerstand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings."
614, Word Embeddings ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"In the last couple of weeks you looked first at Tokenizing words to get numeric values from them, and then using Embeddings to group words of similar meaning depending on how they were labelled. This gave you a good, but rough, sentiment analysis -- words such as 'fun' and 'entertaining' might show up in a positive movie review, and 'boring' and 'dull' might show up in a negative one. But sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear. For example, you could have 'not fun', which of course is the opposite of 'fun'. This week you'll start digging into a variety of model formats that are used in training models to understand context in sequence!"
615,Sequence models,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"Taking everything that you've learned in training a neural network based on NLP, we thought it might be a bit of fun to turn the tables away from classification and use your knowledge for prediction. Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once you've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, this week you'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of it's own!"
616,Sequence models and literature,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"deeplearning.ai is Andrew Ng's new venture which amongst others, strives for providing comprehensive AI education beyond borders."

618,Deep Neural Networks for Time Series,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,Recurrent Neural networks and Long Short Term Memory networks are really useful to classify and predict on sequential data. This week we'll explore using them with time series...
619,Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,"On top of DNNs and RNNs, let's also add convolutions, and then put it all together using a real-world data series -- one which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years, and see if we can predict using it."

621,Introduction to TensorFlow.js,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow,"This week we'll look at Computer Vision problems, including some of the unique considerations when using JavaScript, such as handling thousands of images for training. By the end of this module you will know how to build a site that lets you draw in the browser and recognizes your handwritten digits!"
622,Image Classification In the Browser,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow,"This week we'll see how to take models that have been created with TensorFlow in Python and convert them to JSON format so that they can run in the browser using Javascript. We will start by looking at two models that have already been pre-converted. One of them is going to be a toxicity classifier, which uses NLP to determine if a phrase is toxic in a number of categories; the other one is Mobilenet which can be used to detect content in images. By the end of this module, you will train a model in Python yourself and convert it to JSON format using the tensorflow.js converter."
623,Converting Models to JSON Format,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow,"One final work type that you'll need when creating Machine Learned applications in the browser is to understand how transfer learning works. This week you'll build a complete web site that uses TensorFlow.js, capturing data from the web cam, and re-training mobilenet to recognize Rock, Paper and Scissors gestures. "

625,Device-based models with TensorFlow Lite,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/device-based-models-tensorflow,"Last week you learned about TensorFlow Lite and you saw how to convert your models from TensorFlow to TensorFlow Lite format. You also learned about the standalone TensorFlow Lite Interpreter which could be used to test these models. You wrapped with an exercise that converted a Fashion MNIST based model to TensorFlow Lite and then tested it with the interpreter.This week you'll look at the first of the deployment types for this course: Android. Android is a versatile operating system that is used in a number of different device type, but most commonly phones, tablets and TV systems. Using TensorFlow Lite you can run your models on Android, so you can bring ML to any of these device types. 

While it helps to understand some Android programming concepts, we hope that you'll be able to follow along even if you don't, and at the very least try out the full sample apps that we'll explore for Image Classification, Object Detection and more!"
626,Running a TF model in an Android App,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/device-based-models-tensorflow,"The other popular mobile operating system is, of course, iOS. So this week you'll do very similar tasks to last week -- learning how to take models and run them on iOS. You'll need some programming background with Swift for iOS to fully understand everything we go through, but even if you don't have this expertise, I think this weeks content is something you'll find fun to explore -- and you'll learn how to build a variety of ML applications that run on this important operating system!"
627,Building the TensorFLow model on IOS,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/device-based-models-tensorflow,"Now that you've looked at TensorFlow Lite and explored building apps on Android and iOS that use it, the next and final step is to explore embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, and learn how to get your models running on that. The nice thing is that the Pi is a full Linux system, so it can run Python, allowing you to either use the full TensorFlow for Training and Inference, or just the Interpreter for Inference. I'd recommend the latter, as training on a Pi can be slow!"

637,Financial Crises,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-regulation,"We dive into details of financial systems this week - looking at how banks function and are regulated. Using the Great Depression as a starting point, I describe what caused the collapse of banks a century ago, to reflect on the impact of the post-depression financial regulations that followed. These regulations included the establishment of international financial institutions that controlled current monetary policies. Being familiar with the current financial regulatory framework and where it comes from provides the basis for understanding the disruptions from the fintech innovations we will be covering next week."
638,Post-crisis regulations,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-regulation,"We've now reached the heart of the course - looking at the context of fintech in emerging economies and what makes them different. To begin we will look at Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) which are one of the key mechanisms used fintech companies to finance themselves.  We are going to focus particularly on South Africa, China, and Brazil, and I have a number of interviews with people involved in banking, financial regulation and fintech from these countries. "
639,Fintech regulation in emerging markets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-regulation,"In this last week of the course, we look at applications of fintech in emerging economies. I have selected two widely adopted applications to explore: peer-to-peer lending and remittances. Because of the costs of banking and the exclusion of millions from formal banking systems, entrepreneurs have been exploring innovative mechanisms to finance business by borrowing from peers. Fintech offers a fast and secure mechanism to transfer remittances that are being widely used across the world - and we will look at some examples.  I also asked people from the banking sector to describe how large formal financial institutions are considering the impact of blockchain and other new technologies. At the end of this week, you will have a chance to apply what you’ve learnt in a final assignment."

641,Cryptographic foundations of the blockchain,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/entrepreneurs-blockchain-technology,"Welcome to the second week of our course. This is the week where it gets real. We will finally have all the ingredients we need to fully grasp what the blockchain is. We start the week off by explaining single and double entry bookkeeping. It's important to understand why double entry bookkeeping improved the integrity of ledges in Italy in the 14th century, to truly appreciate how novel and revolutionary the blockchain is. For hundreds of years, double-entry bookkeeping was the method of choice when it comes to financial accounting. In double-entry bookkeeping, the two parties in a transaction each update their books, which provides some security against fraudulent actors. With the emergence of the distributed ledger technology and the blockchain however, we have seen a fundamental paradigm shift in accounting. The accounting perspective is very useful when we want to understand the blockchain as a distributed ledger. Distributed ledger is shared among a number of counterparties who want to transact with one another. A blockchain collects a number of transactions in the block, and through clever combination of cryptography and incentive schemes, ensures that these blocks cannot be altered. Each block contains a reference to the previous block, which is how a chain of blocks turns into a blockchain. We will discuss the different consensus mechanisms and cover both proof of work and proof-of-stake in detail. You will understand both the theory behind them and how they are applied in different block chains. This is an exciting week so let's get started."
642,Mastering the blockchain technology,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/entrepreneurs-blockchain-technology,"Welcome to the third week of our course. This week we will explore more technology that is also disrupting the financial services industry, specifically artificial intelligence or AI. We will actually get our hands dirty and cover the three streams of AI, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as reinforcement learning. All three methods are widely used in the financial services industry already, and we kick the week off by giving you a bird's-eye view of the possible applications of AI in finance. Then we turn to unsupervised machine learning, which is mainly used to cluster large amounts of high dimensional and unstructured data. This has many applications in the financial services industry. Once we have covered unsupervised learning, we then dive into supervised machine learning, which is a brilliant way to classify large amounts of data. A supervised machine learning algorithm must be trained on the training data set, which is often historical data. Once properly trained, the algorithm can then correctly classify patterns in new data, which is why supervised machine learning is so powerful. The idea of training data is then taken one step further in reinforcement learning, where algorithms learn from their interactions with the environment just like a human would. Reinforcement learning is an immensely powerful tool, and many big Wall Street firms are heavily investing into AI trading algorithms that really use reinforcement learning at their heart. Once we have all this heavy material covered, it's time to treat ourselves. So, at the end of this week, you will meet a number of guest lecturers from the financial services industry who will explain to you how their companies are successfully using AI in their business. This is a big week, where we look beyond the blockchain and to the second big pillar of the Fintech revolution, AI and machine learning."
643,How Artificial Intelligence Changes Data Analytics,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/entrepreneurs-blockchain-technology,"Welcome to the fourth week of our course. So, this week, we turn to applications of the blockchain outside of the traditional financial services industry. Since this is a course on FinTech, we will still focus on applications that have ties either with payment services or other financial services. But the main applications are really outside of finance. The first such application is the new architecture of the Internet, the Web 3.0. The current Internet paradigm, the Web 2.0 is built on uses handing that data to large corporations like Facebook or Twitter, and exchange for free services. But as we've seen with a fake news scandal around the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit referendum, this business model comes with its disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage is privacy. Once a user post his personal data to for example a social media website, he has no longer control over the data. This is where the blockchain comes in. With a blockchain, is possible to give uses ownership of their data to ensure that they have full control over their personal sensitive information. So, this week, you will learn how the blockchain changes at prevailing Web 2.0 business model, and provides endless possibilities for truly decentralized Internet. We will then talk about possible drawbacks to blockchains, and when it is appropriate to use a blockchain and when it is not. There is as much to do for us this week. So, let's dive right in."

Тематическая модель позволяет для каждого документа найти темы, которые его описывают, и кроме того показывает, какие слова характеризуют ту или иную тему. Другими словами, мы находим более компактное представление большого набора текстов в виде нескольких тем. С математической точки зрения тематическая модель — это еще один вид матричного разложения, где в качестве исходной матрицы выступает матрица частот слов в документах.

792,Introduction and Overview,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In this module, we define the Bayesian network representation and its semantics. We also analyze the relationship between the graph structure and the independence properties of a distribution represented over that graph. Finally, we give some practical tips on how to model a real-world situation as a Bayesian network."
793,Bayesian Network (Directed Models),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In many cases, we need to model distributions that have a recurring structure. In this module, we describe representations for two such situations. One is temporal scenarios, where we want to model a probabilistic structure that holds constant over time; here, we use Hidden Markov Models, or, more generally, Dynamic Bayesian Networks. The other is aimed at scenarios that involve multiple similar entities, each of whose properties is governed by a similar model; here, we use Plate Models."
794,Template Models for Bayesian Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,A table-based representation of a CPD in a Bayesian network has a size that grows exponentially in the number of parents. There are a variety of other form of CPD that exploit some type of structure in the dependency model to allow for a much more compact representation. Here we describe a number of the ones most commonly used in practice.
795,Structured CPDs for Bayesian Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In this module, we describe Markov networks (also called Markov random fields): probabilistic graphical models based on an undirected graph representation. We discuss the representation of these models and their semantics. We also analyze the independence properties of distributions encoded by these graphs, and their relationship to the graph structure. We compare these independencies to those encoded by a Bayesian network, giving us some insight on which type of model is more suitable for which scenarios."
796,Markov Networks (Undirected Models),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In this module, we discuss the task of decision making under uncertainty. We describe the framework of decision theory, including some aspects of utility functions. We then talk about how decision making scenarios can be encoded as a graphical model called an Influence Diagram, and how such models provide insight both into decision making and the value of information gathering."
797,Decision Making,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,This module provides an overview of graphical model representations and some of the real-world considerations when modeling a scenario as a graphical model. It also includes the course final exam.

799,Inference Overview ,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"This module presents the simplest algorithm for exact inference in graphical models: variable elimination. We describe the algorithm, and analyze its complexity in terms of properties of the graph structure."
800,Variable Elimination,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,This module describes an alternative view of exact inference in graphical models: that of message passing between clusters each of which encodes a factor over a subset of variables. This framework provides a basis for a variety of exact and approximate inference algorithms. We focus here on the basic framework and on its instantiation in the exact case of clique tree propagation. An optional lesson describes the loopy belief propagation (LBP) algorithm and its properties.
801,Belief Propagation Algorithms ,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"This module describes algorithms for finding the most likely assignment for a distribution encoded as a PGM (a task known as MAP inference). We describe message passing algorithms, which are very similar to the algorithms for computing conditional probabilities, except that we need to also consider how to decode the results to construct a single assignment. In an optional module, we describe a few other algorithms that are able to use very different techniques by exploiting the combinatorial optimization nature of the MAP task."
802,MAP Algorithms,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"In this module, we discuss a class of algorithms that uses random sampling to provide approximate answers to conditional probability queries. Most commonly used among these is the class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which includes the simple Gibbs sampling algorithm, as well as a family of methods known as Metropolis-Hastings."
803,Sampling Methods,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"In this brief lesson, we discuss some of the complexities of applying some of the exact or approximate inference algorithms that we learned earlier in this course to dynamic Bayesian networks."

We discuss maximum likelihood estimation, and the issues with it. We then discuss Bayesian estimation and how it can ameliorate these problems."
808,Parameter Estimation in Bayesian Networks,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-3-learning,"In this module, we discuss the parameter estimation problem for Markov networks - undirected graphical models. This task is considerably more complex, both conceptually and computationally, than parameter estimation for Bayesian networks, due to the issues presented by the global partition function."
809,Learning Undirected Models,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-3-learning,"This module discusses the problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks. We first discuss how this problem can be formulated as an optimization problem over a space of graph structures, and what are good ways to score different structures so as to trade off fit to data and model complexity. We then talk about how the optimization problem can be solved: exactly in a few cases, approximately in most others."
810,Learning BN Structure,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-3-learning,"In this module, we discuss the problem of learning models in cases where some of the variables in some of the data cases are not fully observed.

1011,Introduction,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mind-machine-artificial-intelligence,"El aprendizaje de máquinas es una rama de la inteligencia artificial dedicada al estudio de métodos para dotar a los agentes artificiales de la capacidad de aprender a partir de ejemplos y/o experiencia. Los métodos de aprendizaje de máquinas pueden generar modelos de problemas complejos a través de instancias específicas, los cuales son capaces de generalizar y/o adaptarse a situaciones nuevas. Estos modelos han permitido llevar a cabo muchas nuevas aplicaciones en áreas muy diversas como generación de descripciones de imágenes, predicción de readmisión hospitalaria o detección de partículas subatómicas. En la actualizada frecuentemente interactuamos con modelos de aprendizaje de máquinas en diversas actividades de nuestra vida cotidiana. Por ejemplo, cuando utilizamos el teclado virtual en nuestros teléfonos móviles, un modelo de aprendizaje de máquinas trata de predecir la siguiente palabra que queremos escribir a partir de nuestro patrón de escritura y la de otros usuarios. De igual manera, al realizar una búsqueda en Internet, un modelo de aprendizaje de máquinas identifica los documentos más relevantes a ser mostrados de todos los posibles documentos usando nuestro historial de búsqueda. Al tomar una foto con nuestra cámara digital, un modelo de aprendizaje de máquinas detecta los rostros en la escena para poder enfocarlos de forma adecuada.Este es un curso básico introductorio al aprendizaje de máquinas con un enfoque práctico, el cual aborda tanto los fundamentos generales como métodos específicos y algunos aspectos prácticos.

This week, we will meet some great people - all former students of mine - now working at super-interesting and exciting jobs as business analysts, business data analysts, or data scientists. We’ll explore what they do, how their role relates to big data, and the skills they needed to get hired! Our hope is this information will give you a better understanding of the type of data-related job you might apply for once you've completed this specialization, and a sense of the type of company you would find most appealing to work for. By the end of this week, you will be able to:  differentiate among different job roles within a company that work with data; identify how each role works with data; and describe the skills required to perform each job role. You will differentiate how different types of companies relate to big data culture, and rank any company according to a 20-item checklist. You will also learn to differentiate how different types of companies relate to big data culture. Included in this week’s materials is a 20-item checklist to rank companies.

The Excel vocabulary and functions taught throughout this module make it possible for you to understand the additional explanatory Excel spreadsheets that accompany later videos in this course. "
1035,Information Measures,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"Separating collections into two categories, such as “buy this stock, don’t but that stock” or “target this customer with a special offer, but not that one” is the ultimate goal of most business data-analysis projects. There is a specialized vocabulary of measures for comparing and optimizing the performance of the algorithms used to classify collections into two groups. You will learn how and why to apply these different metrics, including how to calculate the all-important AUC: the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. "
1036,Linear Regression,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"In this module, you will learn how to calculate and apply the vitally useful uncertainty metric known as “entropy.” In contrast to the more familiar “probability” that represents the uncertainty that a single outcome will occur, “entropy” quantifies the aggregate uncertainty of all possible outcomes.The entropy measure provides the framework for accountability in data-analytic work. Entropy gives you the power to quantify the uncertainty of future outcomes relevant to your business twice: using the best-available estimates before you begin a project, and then again after you have built a predictive model.
The difference between the two measures is the Information Gain contributed by your work."
1037,Additional Skills for Model Building,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"The Linear Correlation measure is a much richer metric for evaluating associations than is commonly realized. You can use it to quantify how much a linear model reduces uncertainty.  When used to forecast future outcomes, it can be converted into a “point estimate” plus a “confidence interval,” or converted into an information gain measure. You will develop a fluent knowledge of these concepts and the many valuable uses to which linear regression is put in business data analysis. This module also teaches how to use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to solve practical problems. The two topics are closely related because regression and the CLT both make use of a special family of probability distributions called “Gaussians.” You will learn everything you need to know to work with Gaussians in these and other contexts. "
1038,Final Course Project,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"This module gives you additional valuable concepts and skills related to building high-quality models. As you know, a “model” is a description of a process applied to available data (inputs) that produces an estimate of a future and as yet unknown outcome as output. 
Very often, models for outputs take the form of a probability distribution. This module covers how to estimate probability distributions from data (a “probability histogram”), and how to describe and generate the most useful probability distributions used by data scientists. It also covers in detail how to develop a binary classification model with parameters optimized to maximize the AUC, and how to apply linear regression models when your input consists of multiple types of data for each event. 
The module concludes with an explanation of “over-fitting” which is the main reason that apparently good predictive models often fail in real life business settings. We conclude with some tips for how you can avoid over-fitting in you own predictive model for the final project – and in real life."
1039,About this Specialization and Course,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-tableau?specialization=excel-mysql,"The final course project is a comprehensive assessment covering all of the course material, and consists of four quizzes and a peer review assignment.
