Currently, this is taken advantage of by the most valuable companies in Silicon Valley, the most powerful governmental agencies, and the most influential social movements. What they have in common is that they use computational tools to understand, and ultimately influence human behavior and social dynamics.

An increasing part of human interaction leaves a massive digital footprint behind. Studying it allows us to gain unprecedented insights into what society is and how it works, including its intricate social networks that had long been obscure. Computational power allows us to detect hidden patterns through analytical tools like machine learning and to natural language processing. Finally, computer simulations enable us to explore hypothetical situations that may not even exist in reality, but that we would like to exist: a better world.

This specialization serves as a multidisciplinary, multi-perspective, and multi-method guide on how to better understand society and human behavior with modern research tools.

Usando una combinaciÃ³n de presentaciones, demostraciones y labs prÃ¡cticos, los participantes aprenderÃ¡n a diseÃ±ar sistemas de procesamiento de datos, compilar canalizaciones de datos de extremo a extremo, analizar datos y llevar a efecto funciones de aprendizaje automÃ¡tico. Este curso le enseÃ±arÃ¡ las siguientes habilidades:

â¢ DiseÃ±ar y crear sistemas de procesamiento de datos en Google Cloud Platform

â¢ Aprovechar los datos no estructurados mediante Spark y las API de AA en Cloud Dataproc

â¢ Procesar los datos por lotes y de transmisiÃ³n mediante la implementaciÃ³n de canalizaciones de datos de ajuste de escala automÃ¡tico en Cloud Dataflow

â¢ Generar estadÃ­sticas empresariales a partir de conjuntos de datos muy grandes mediante Google BigQuery

â¢ Entrenar, evaluar y predecir por medio de los modelos de aprendizaje automÃ¡tico con Tensorflow y Cloud ML

â¢ Extraer estadÃ­sticas al instante a partir de los datos de transmisiÃ³n

Este curso estÃ¡ dirigido a desarrolladores experimentados responsables de la administraciÃ³n de transformaciones de macrodatos.
