62,Applying Business Metrics to a Business Case Study,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics?specialization=excel-mysql,"Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge. The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world."
63,About This Course,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"In this module, will explore the essential Excel skills to address typical business situations you may encounter in the future. The Excel vocabulary and functions taught throughout this module make it possible for you to understand the additional explanatory Excel spreadsheets that accompany later videos in this course. "
64,Excel Essentials for Beginners,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"Separating collections into two categories, such as “buy this stock, don’t but that stock” or “target this customer with a special offer, but not that one” is the ultimate goal of most business data-analysis projects. There is a specialized vocabulary of measures for comparing and optimizing the performance of the algorithms used to classify collections into two groups. You will learn how and why to apply these different metrics, including how to calculate the all-important AUC: the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. "
65,Binary Classification,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"In this module, you will learn how to calculate and apply the vitally useful uncertainty metric known as “entropy.” In contrast to the more familiar “probability” that represents the uncertainty that a single outcome will occur, “entropy” quantifies the aggregate uncertainty of all possible outcomes.The entropy measure provides the framework for accountability in data-analytic work. Entropy gives you the power to quantify the uncertainty of future outcomes relevant to your business twice: using the best-available estimates before you begin a project, and then again after you have built a predictive model.
The difference between the two measures is the Information Gain contributed by your work."
66,Information Measures,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"The Linear Correlation measure is a much richer metric for evaluating associations than is commonly realized. You can use it to quantify how much a linear model reduces uncertainty.  When used to forecast future outcomes, it can be converted into a “point estimate” plus a “confidence interval,” or converted into an information gain measure. You will develop a fluent knowledge of these concepts and the many valuable uses to which linear regression is put in business data analysis. This module also teaches how to use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to solve practical problems. The two topics are closely related because regression and the CLT both make use of a special family of probability distributions called “Gaussians.” You will learn everything you need to know to work with Gaussians in these and other contexts. "
67,Linear Regression,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"This module gives you additional valuable concepts and skills related to building high-quality models. As you know, a “model” is a description of a process applied to available data (inputs) that produces an estimate of a future and as yet unknown outcome as output. 
Very often, models for outputs take the form of a probability distribution. This module covers how to estimate probability distributions from data (a “probability histogram”), and how to describe and generate the most useful probability distributions used by data scientists. It also covers in detail how to develop a binary classification model with parameters optimized to maximize the AUC, and how to apply linear regression models when your input consists of multiple types of data for each event. 
The module concludes with an explanation of “over-fitting” which is the main reason that apparently good predictive models often fail in real life business settings. We conclude with some tips for how you can avoid over-fitting in you own predictive model for the final project – and in real life."
68,Additional Skills for Model Building,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"The final course project is a comprehensive assessment covering all of the course material, and consists of four quizzes and a peer review assignment.

106,Installing and Using Python,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In the first chapter we try to cover the ""big picture"" of programming so you get a ""table of contents"" of the rest of the book.   Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it.   This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in.  You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters."
107,Chapter One: Why We Program (continued),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information."
108,Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.  It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes ""choices""."
109,Chapter Three: Conditional Code,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"This is a relatively short chapter.   We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code."
110,Chapter Four: Functions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.  Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over.   Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.

114,Chapter Seven: Files,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables.  Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable.  Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.  We call these multi-valued variables ""collections"" or ""data structures""."
115,Chapter Eight: Lists,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures.  Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs.  Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory ""database"" in a single Python variable."

In this second part of this week, we'll walk you through setting up your system and working through your first assignment so you'll be having fun with it in no time. Before that though, we'll finish going over some of the fundamentals fundamentals of object oriented programming.  Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. Like the end of last week, the first part of this week might be a bit of a review of material you already learned in your first Java programming course.

Specifically, the keyword “extends”.  What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism.  These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future!  We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently.  If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this week.  As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.    "

Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here.  We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us.

The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice. "
822,Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"This week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer."

You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!  You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now.  :)"
