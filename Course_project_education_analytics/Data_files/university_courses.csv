43, Analytical Decision Making ,"Good managerial decisions depend on an understanding not only of the problem structure, parameters, and constraints, but also of the organizational context in which the decision will be implemented. In this course, we will explore the use of a variety of analytical methods to assist in the mechanics of problem solving and case studies and illustrations to illuminate contextual issues. The general approach we will follow will be to construct an analytical representation of the problem, called a model. This model will be manipulated, or ""solved"", to identify the decision that yields the ""best"" outcome. Finally, the model results are applied back to the original managerial problem, or implemented.In this course, we shall concentrate on the processes of problem recognition, model formulation, and interpretation of the model results and implementation. We will not focus on algorithmic details of specific model solution, but rather will use pre-tested computer routines in most cases. The intention of the course is to help you become a perceptive and critical user of quantitative models in an organization. Decision models can be divided into two main categories: those that assume that the variables within, and outcomes from, a decision problem are known with certainty (called deterministic models), and those which introduce elements of uncertainty or risk (called stochastic models). We will examine models from each of these categories, chosen on the basis of degree of use in current practice. Case studies will help in developing facility with model formulation and interpretation of results, and will aid development of an intuition about effective use of modeling. The phenomenal power for problem analysis provided by modern spreadsheets will be exploited in the course, using EXCEL and EXCEL Add-Ins (@RISK and Precision Tree)."
