And apply it to text-mining algorithm called Latent Dirichlet Allocation
54,Markov chain Monte Carlo,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning?specialization=aml,This week we will learn how to approximate training and inference with sampling and how to sample from complicated distributions. This will allow us to build simple method to deal with LDA and with Bayesian Neural Networks — Neural Networks which weights are random variables themselves and instead of training (finding the best value for the weights) we will sample from the posterior distributions on weights.
55,Variational Autoencoder,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning?specialization=aml,"Welcome to the fifth week of the course! This week we will combine many ideas from the previous weeks and add some new to build Variational Autoencoder -- a model that can learn a distribution over structured data (like photographs or molecules) and then sample new data points from the learned distribution, hallucinating new photographs of non-existing people. We will also the same techniques to Bayesian Neural Networks and will see how this can greatly compress the weights of the network without reducing the accuracy."

All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along.You'll be working with code that works well across both TensorFlow 1.x and the TensorFlow 2.0 alpha. 

To get started, check out the first video, a conversation between Andrew and Laurence that sets the theme for what you'll study..."
65,Introduction to Computer Vision,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,Welcome to week 2 of the course! In week 1 you learned all about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning is a new programming paradigm. This week you’re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code! Check out this conversation between Laurence and Andrew where they discuss it and introduce you to Computer Vision!
66,Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"Welcome to week 3! In week 2 you saw a basic Neural Network for Computer Vision.

67,Using Real-world Images,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"Last week you saw how to improve the results from your deep neural network using convolutions. It was a good start, but the data you used was very basic. What happens when your images are larger, or if the features aren’t always in the same place? Andrew and Laurence discuss this to prepare you for what you’ll learn this week: handling complex images!"
68,Exploring a Larger Dataset,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"In the first course in this specialization, you had an introduction to TensorFlow, and how, with its high level APIs you could do basic image classification, an you learned a little bit about Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this course you'll go deeper into using ConvNets will real-world data, and learn about techniques that you can use to improve your ConvNet performance, particularly when doing image classification!In Week 1, this week, you'll get started by looking at a much larger dataset than you've been using thus far: The Cats and Dogs dataset which had been a Kaggle Challenge in image classification!"
69,Augmentation: A technique to avoid overfitting,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"You've heard the term overfitting a number of times to this point. Overfitting is simply the concept of being over specialized in training -- namely that your model is very good at classifying what it is trained for, but not so good at classifying things that it hasn't seen. In order to generalize your model more effectively, you will of course need a greater breadth of samples to train it on. That's not always possible, but a nice potential shortcut to this is Image Augmentation, where you tweak the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers. You'll learn all about that this week!"
70,Transfer Learning,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as you've seen, you can be limited by the data you have on hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively. Transfer learning can help solve this -- where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that you can either use them directly, or, you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario. This is Transfer learning, and you'll look into that this week!"
71,Multiclass Classifications,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"You've come a long way, Congratulations! One more thing to do before we move off of ConvNets to the next module, and that's to go beyond binary classification. Each of the examples you've done so far involved classifying one thing or another -- horse or human, cat or dog. When moving beyond binary into Categorical classification there are some coding considerations you need to take into account. You'll look at them this week!"
72,Sentiment in text,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"The first step in understanding sentiment in text, and in particular when training a neural network to do so is the tokenization of that text. This is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character. This week you'll learn about the Tokenizer and pad_sequences APIs in TensorFlow and how they can be used to prepare and encode text and sentences to get them ready for training neural networks!"
73, Word Embeddings ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"Last week you saw how to use the Tokenizer to prepare your text to be used by a neural network by converting words into numeric tokens, and sequencing sentences from these tokens. This week you'll learn about Embeddings, where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space. With Embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space. This will begin the process of training a neural network to udnerstand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings."
74,Sequence models,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"In the last couple of weeks you looked first at Tokenizing words to get numeric values from them, and then using Embeddings to group words of similar meaning depending on how they were labelled. This gave you a good, but rough, sentiment analysis -- words such as 'fun' and 'entertaining' might show up in a positive movie review, and 'boring' and 'dull' might show up in a negative one. But sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear. For example, you could have 'not fun', which of course is the opposite of 'fun'. This week you'll start digging into a variety of model formats that are used in training models to understand context in sequence!"
75,Sequence models and literature,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"Taking everything that you've learned in training a neural network based on NLP, we thought it might be a bit of fun to turn the tables away from classification and use your knowledge for prediction. Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once you've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, this week you'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of it's own!"
76,Sequences and Prediction,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,"Hi Learners and welcome to this course on sequences and prediction! In this course we'll take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series, building on what you've learned in previous courses!"
77,Deep Neural Networks for Time Series,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,"Having explored time series and some of the common attributes of time series such as trend and seasonality, and then having used statistical methods for projection, let's now begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series!"
78,Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,Recurrent Neural networks and Long Short Term Memory networks are really useful to classify and predict on sequential data. This week we'll explore using them with time series...
79,Real-world time series data,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,"On top of DNNs and RNNs, let's also add convolutions, and then put it all together using a real-world data series -- one which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years, and see if we can predict using it."

We also analyze the relationship between the graph structure and the independence properties of a distribution represented over that graph. Finally, we give some practical tips on how to model a real-world situation as a Bayesian network."
135,Template Models for Bayesian Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In many cases, we need to model distributions that have a recurring structure. In this module, we describe representations for two such situations. One is temporal scenarios, where we want to model a probabilistic structure that holds constant over time; here, we use Hidden Markov Models, or, more generally, Dynamic Bayesian Networks. The other is aimed at scenarios that involve multiple similar entities, each of whose properties is governed by a similar model; here, we use Plate Models."
136,Structured CPDs for Bayesian Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,A table-based representation of a CPD in a Bayesian network has a size that grows exponentially in the number of parents. There are a variety of other form of CPD that exploit some type of structure in the dependency model to allow for a much more compact representation. Here we describe a number of the ones most commonly used in practice.
137,Markov Networks (Undirected Models),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In this module, we describe Markov networks (also called Markov random fields): probabilistic graphical models based on an undirected graph representation. We discuss the representation of these models and their semantics. We also analyze the independence properties of distributions encoded by these graphs, and their relationship to the graph structure. We compare these independencies to those encoded by a Bayesian network, giving us some insight on which type of model is more suitable for which scenarios."

An optional lesson describes the loopy belief propagation (LBP) algorithm and its properties.
143,MAP Algorithms,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"This module describes algorithms for finding the most likely assignment for a distribution encoded as a PGM (a task known as MAP inference).

In an optional module, we describe a few other algorithms that are able to use very different techniques by exploiting the combinatorial optimization nature of the MAP task."
144,Sampling Methods,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"In this module, we discuss a class of algorithms that uses random sampling to provide approximate answers to conditional probability queries.

406,Chapter One - Why we Program?,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,These are the course-wide materials as well as the first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs.  We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course you may want to come back and look at these materials.  This section should not take you an entire week. 
407,Installing and Using Python,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the ""Using Python in this Class"" material for details."
408,Chapter One: Why We Program (continued),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In the first chapter we try to cover the ""big picture"" of programming so you get a ""table of contents"" of the rest of the book.   Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it.   This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in.  You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters."
409,Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information."
410,Chapter Three: Conditional Code,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.  It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes ""choices""."
411,Chapter Four: Functions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"This is a relatively short chapter.   We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code."
412,Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.  Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over.   Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.
413,Chapter Six: Strings,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"In this class, we pick up where we left off in the previous class, starting in Chapter 6 of the textbook and covering Strings and moving into data structures.   The second week of this class is dedicated to getting Python installed if you want to actually run the applications on your desktop or laptop.  If you choose not to install Python, you can just skip to the third week and get a head start."
414,Unit: Installing and Using Python,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  We do not require installation of Python for this class.  You can write and test Python programs in the browser using the ""Python Code Playground"" in this lesson.  Please read the ""Using Python in this Class"" material for details."
415,Chapter Seven: Files,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"Up to now, we have been working with data that is read from the user or data in constants.   But real programs process much larger amounts of data by reading and writing files on the secondary storage on your computer.   In this chapter we start to write our first programs that read, scan, and process real data.  "
416,Chapter Eight: Lists,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables.  Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable.  Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.  We call these multi-valued variables ""collections"" or ""data structures""."
417,Chapter Nine: Dictionaries,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures.  Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs.  Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory ""database"" in a single Python variable."
418,Chapter Ten: Tuples,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure.  Tuples are a simple version of lists.  We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.

In previous classes in the specialization this was an optional assignment, but in this class it is the first requirement to get started.  From this point forward we will stop using the browser-based Python grading environment because the browser-based Python environment (Skulpt) is not capable of running the more complex programs we will be developing in this class."
421,Regular Expressions (Chapter 11),6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python,"Regular expressions are a very specialized language that allow us to succinctly search strings and extract data from strings.   Regular expressions are a language unto themselves.  It is not essential to know how to use regular expressions, but they can be quite useful and powerful."
422,Networks and Sockets (Chapter 12),6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python,In this section we learn about the protocols that web browsers use to retrieve documents and web applications use to interact with Application Program Interfaces (APIs).

426,Object Oriented Python,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python,"To start this class out we cover the basics of Object Oriented Python. We won't be writing our own objects, but since many of the things we use like BeautifulSoup, strings, dictionaries, database connections all use Object Oriented (OO) patterns we should at least understand some of its patterns and terminology."
427,Basic Structured Query Language,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python,"We learn the four core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to manage data stored in a database."
428,Data Models and Relational SQL,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python,"In this section we learn about how data is stored across multiple tables in a database and how rows are linked (i.e., we establish relationships) in the database."
429,Many-to-Many Relationships in SQL,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python,In this section we explore how to model situations like students enrolling in courses where each course has many students and each student is enrolled in many courses.

Specifically, the keyword “extends”.  What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism.  These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future!  We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently.  If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this week.  As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.    "

This week is all about getting comfortable and excited to learn."
490,Working with Strings,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we're going to dive into the course programming project.  In the first lesson you'll learn about Strings and Regular Expressions, and in the programming assignment this week you'll apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the ""readability"" of text by calculating something called the ""Flesch Readability Score"".  This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly.  So, let's get started building some code!"
491,Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Welcome to week 3!  The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice. "
492,"Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and Correctness",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer."
493,Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries),6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Welcome to week 4!  We know you've been working hard.  We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries.  You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!  You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now.  :)"
494,Hash Maps and Edit Distance,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"You made it to the last week!  Congratulations on getting this far!  In this last week we'll be looking at a fundamental data structure called a Hash Table.  If you thought trees were fast, just wait until you see what Hash Tables can do!   Your last programming assignment will add spelling correction suggestions to your text editor, and there's an optional assignment that builds on the same ideas as the main assignment too, if you have the time and energy.  "
495,Introduction to the Course,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Welcome to the first week in the third course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization.  Once again start with introductions, and in particular introduce the unique structure of this course.  Also, if you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz coming right up that can help you figure out if you're in the right place.  If you decide to stay with us (and we really hope you will!) we've got a great backbone project for you: your very own mapping application, inspired by Google Maps!  The core data structure throughout this course is graphs, which may very well be the most fundamental data structure in all of computer science.  Ready to begin?  So are we!"
496,Introduction to Graphs,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we'll start getting technical, introducing you to the central data structure in the course: Graphs.  You'll learn the basics and then have a chance to dive in a little deeper into the code, getting ready to start building that Google Maps-like application."
497,Class design and simple graph search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week you'll get the backbone of your map search engine up and running.  In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments.  But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer.  This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine.  We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph.  Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search.  Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes.   Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine!"
498,Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"In the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map.  In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a ""weighted graph"".  Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs.  To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.  In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another."
499,Route planning and NP-hard graph problems,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"In this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning.  For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve ""hard"" problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms.  We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!  "
500,End of Course Project Extension,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"You made it to the last week of our course!  We're glad you're still with us.  As a reward, there's no new content to learn this week.  Instead you'll get the opportunity to extend your project in a direction of your own choosing.  We hope you've got some neat ideas for personalizing your map application, and we look forward to seeing them in the peer review gallery.  Submitting to the peer review gallery is optional (though the extension is required), but we hope you'll choose to participate.  "
501,Welcome & What is a Software Engineering Interview?,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Welcome to our course on effectively communicating your technical abilities.  This course focuses on landing a technical job and excelling in a technical role.  To succeed in job interviews, you’ll need to be able to confidently articulate your ability to solve challenging problems and come up with new solutions under potentially stressful conditions. After getting a technical job, the role of communication increases even more.  You’ll need to work with other members of the team, communicate technical challenges and successes, and potentially sell the value of your work to those outside the company. Our goal is that by the end of this course each and every one of you understands the importance of technical communication, and has received constructive feedback on areas of potential improvement.  In achieving this goal you will also learn about algorithmic thinking on the fly, how to evaluate a good interview answer to a difficult technical problem, and how “soft” skills impact interview outcomes.   In this module, we’ll begin to see what a technical interview looks like, from the perspective of a major tech company.  We’ll then focus on how to best get the interview in the first place.  If you're not in the job market right now, you might want to skim the videos in this module and skip ahead to the Resume Critique (for insights about how to present yourself in writing) or the Introductions assignment (on effectively presenting yourself in person)."

503,Live coding: the technical phone interview and beyond,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Now that you’ve gotten warmed up, it’s time to practice your coding skills.  One of the things you’ll almost certainly be asked to do during a technical phone interview is to code up a solution to a problem in a shared text document (e.g. Google doc) while you are on the phone with the interviewer.  This experience can be intimidating, unfamiliar and humbling if you are not prepared, so this week we will give you lots of practice and tips for getting through this part of the interview with flying colors.  "
504,Explaining what you've already done,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week, we’re going to focus on how to speak about your experiences working on projects and how to speak about the technical problems you’ve experienced and how you’ve solved those problems.  We’ll introduce the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Results) model for presenting your work, and discuss how to and how not to present the problem you worked on and the solution you developed.  We’ll also discuss the communication skills that are critical to this task.  It’s a fun week with lots of examples (both good and bad), which ends with an assignment where you will present your own work on video and submit this video for peer review."

506,Algorithmic thinking on the fly,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"As we saw in week 2, coding on the fly can be a difficult task!  In this final week of the course we’ll revisit the skill of live problem solving by looking at how to solve more challenging algorithmic problems (and write the code associated with the solution) on the whiteboard.  You’ll recognize these problems as “classic” interview problems you’ve probably heard a lot about, designed to test your problem solving skills as well as your analysis and coding abilities.  Don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to approach them with confidence through a 6-step process to addressing technical questions (hint: you don’t have to produce the perfect solution on the first try!).  We’ll show you how to use this process in a number of examples.  But of course, there is no substitute for practice, so we’ll set you up with how to train and evaluate yourself."

In this week, we'll get started by introducing ourselves and the Google engineers who will be making appearances throughout the course.  We'll also give you of the unique video series we provide and help you understand how to navigate the course to get the most out of it given your background and learning speed.  Finally, we'll jump right into objects and designing classes.  This might be a bit of review for some of you who might have learned this in your first programming course.  If that's the case, feel free to jump ahead to the Practice Quiz at the end of the week. Let's get started!"
604,"Memory Models, Scope, and Starting the Project",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java,"We hope you’re excited about the project that we're starting to build -- we sure are!  In this second part of this week, we'll walk you through setting up your system and working through your first assignment so you'll be having fun with it in no time. Before that though, we'll finish going over some of the fundamentals fundamentals of object oriented programming.  Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. Like the end of last week, the first part of this week might be a bit of a review of material you already learned in your first Java programming course.  If that’s the case, you are always welcome to skip to the first graded assignment on Objects, Memory Models, and Scope."

In this last module we'll shift gears a bit to talk about some very exciting and fundamental algorithms for finding and sorting data in an array.  Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here.  We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us.   We'll also apply sorting to your project, and you'll wrap things up by finishing your project with an extension of your own choosing."
609,Introduction to the Course,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"Welcome to the first module in the second course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization.

This week is all about getting comfortable and excited to learn."
610,Working with Strings,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"This week we're going to dive into the course programming project.  In the first lesson you'll learn about Strings and Regular Expressions, and in the programming assignment this week you'll apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the ""readability"" of text by calculating something called the ""Flesch Readability Score"".  This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly.  So, let's get started building some code!"
611,Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"Welcome to week 3!  The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice. "
612,"Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and Correctness",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"This week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer."
613,Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries),6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"Welcome to week 4!  We know you've been working hard.  We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries.  You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!  You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now.  :)"
614,Hash Maps and Edit Distance,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"You made it to the last week!  Congratulations on getting this far!  In this last week we'll be looking at a fundamental data structure called a Hash Table.  If you thought trees were fast, just wait until you see what Hash Tables can do!   Your last programming assignment will add spelling correction suggestions to your text editor, and there's an optional assignment that builds on the same ideas as the main assignment too, if you have the time and energy.

What are some examples of data science projects?  "
616,Relational Databases and the Relational Algebra,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"Relational Databases are the workhouse of large-scale data management.  Although originally motivated by problems in enterprise operations, they have proven remarkably capable for analytics as well.  But most importantly, the principles underlying relational databases are universal in managing, manipulating, and analyzing data at scale.  Even as the landscape of large-scale data systems has expanded dramatically in the last decade, relational models and languages have remained a unifying concept.  For working with large-scale data, there is no more important programming model to learn."
617,MapReduce and Parallel Dataflow Programming,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"The MapReduce programming model (as distinct from its implementations) was proposed as a simplifying abstraction for parallel manipulation of massive datasets, and remains an important concept to know when using and evaluating modern big data platforms.  "
618,NoSQL: Systems and Concepts,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"NoSQL systems are purely about scale rather than analytics, and are arguably less relevant for the practicing data scientist.  However, they occupy an important place in many practical big data platform architectures, and data scientists need to understand their limitations and strengths to use them effectively."
619,Graph Analytics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"Graph-structured data are increasingly common in data science contexts due to their ubiquity in modeling the communication between entities: people (social networks), computers (Internet communication), cities and countries (transportation networks), or corporations (financial transactions).

624,Visualization,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-results,"Statistical inferences from large, heterogeneous, and noisy datasets are useless if you can't communicate them to your colleagues, your customers, your management and other stakeholders.  Learn the fundamental concepts behind information visualization, an increasingly critical field of research and increasingly important skillset for data scientists.  This module is taught by Cecilia Aragon, faculty in the Human Centered Design and Engineering Department."
625,Privacy and Ethics,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-results,"Big Data has become closely linked to issues of privacy and ethics: As the limits on what we *can* do with data continue to evaporate, the question of what we *should* do with data becomes paramount.  Motivated in the context of case studies, you will learn the core principles of codes of conduct for data science and statistical analysis.  You will learn the limits of current theory on protecting privacy while still permitting useful statistical analysis. "
626,Reproducibility and Cloud Computing,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-results,"Science is facing a credibility crisis due to unreliable reproducibility, and as research becomes increasingly computational, the problem seems to be paradoxically getting worse.  But reproducibility is not just for academics: Data scientists who cannot share, explain, and defend their methods for others to build on are dangerous.  In this module, you will explore the importance of reproducible research and how cloud computing is offering new mechanisms for sharing code, data, environments, and even costs that are critical for practical reproducibility."

<p>This week, we will study how to find a highest scoring alignment of two strings. We will see that regardless of the underlying assumptions that we make regarding how the strings should be aligned, we will be able to phrase our alignment problem as an instance of finding the longest path in a directed acyclic graph.</p>"
645,Week 3: Advanced Topics in Sequence Alignment,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparing-genomes?specialization=bioinformatics,"<p>Welcome to Week 3 of the class!</p><p>Last week, we saw how a variety of different applications of sequence alignment can all be reduced to finding the longest path in a Manhattan-like graph.</p>

<p>This week, we will conclude the current chapter by considering a few advanced topics in sequence alignment. For example, if we need to align long strings, our current algorithm will consume a huge amount of memory. Can we find a more memory-efficient approach? And what should we do when we move from aligning just two strings at a time to aligning many strings?</p>"
646,Week 4: Genome Rearrangements and Fragility,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparing-genomes?specialization=bioinformatics,"<p>Welcome to Week 4 of the class!</p><p>You now know how to compare two DNA (or protein) strings. &nbsp;But what if we wanted to compare entire genomes? When we ""zoom out"" to the genome level, we find that substitutions, insertions, and deletions don't tell the whole story of evolution: we need to model more dramatic evolutionary events known as <strong>genome rearrangements</strong>, which wrench apart chromosomes and put them back together in a new order. A natural question to ask is whether there are ""fragile regions"" hidden in your genome where chromosome breakage has occurred more often over millions of years. This week, we will begin addressing this question by asking how we can compute the number of rearrangements on the evolutionary path connecting two species.</p>

673,Course Overview and Introductions,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,"The 'Introduction to Complex Systems' module discusses complex systems and leads to the idea that a cell can be considered a complex system or a complex agent living in a complex environment just like us. The 'Introduction to Biology for Engineers' module provides an introduction to some central topics in cell and molecular biology for those who do not have the background in the field. This is not a comprehensive coverage of cell and molecular biology. The goal is to provide an entry point to motivate those who are interested in this field, coming from other disciplines, to begin studying biology."
674,Topological and Network Evolution Models,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,"In the 'Topological and Network Evolution Models' module, we provide several lectures about a historical perspective of network analysis in systems biology. The focus is on in-silico network evolution models. These are simple computational models that, based of few rules, can create networks that have a similar topology to the molecular networks observed in biological systems. "
675,Types of Biological Networks,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,The 'Types of Biological Networks' module is about the various types of networks that are typically constructed and analyzed in systems biology and systems pharmacology. This lecture ends with the idea of functional association networks (FANs). Following this lecture are lectures that discuss how to construct FANs and how to use these networks for analyzing gene lists.  
676,Data Processing and Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,"This set of lectures in the 'Data Processing and Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes' module first discusses data normalization methods, and then several lectures are devoted to explaining the problem of identifying differentially expressed genes with the focus on understanding the inner workings of a new method developed by the Ma'ayan Laboratory called the Characteristic Direction. "
677,Gene Set Enrichment and Network Analyses,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,"In the 'Gene Set Enrichment and Network Analyses' module the emphasis is on tools developed by the Ma'ayan Laboratory to analyze gene sets. Several tools will be discussed including: Enrichr, GEO2Enrichr, Expression2Kinases and DrugPairSeeker. In addition, one lecture will be devoted to a method we call enrichment vector clustering we developed, and two lectures will describe the popular gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method and an improved method we developed called principal angle enrichment analysis (PAEA)."
678,Deep Sequencing Data Processing and Analysis,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,"A set of lectures in the 'Deep Sequencing Data Processing and Analysis' module will cover the basic steps and popular pipelines to analyze RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data going from the raw data to gene lists to figures. These lectures also cover UNIX/Linux commands and some programming elements of R, a popular freely available statistical software. Note that since these lectures were developed and recorded during the Fall of 2013, it is possible that there are better tools that should be used now since the field is rapidly advancing.  "
679,"Principal Component Analysis, Self-Organizing Maps, Network-Based Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering",10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,"This module is devoted to various method of clustering: principal component analysis, self-organizing maps, network-based clustering and hierarchical clustering. The theory behind these methods of analysis are covered in detail, and this is followed by some practical demonstration of the methods for applications using R and MATLAB."
680,Resources for Data Integration,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,The lectures in the 'Resources for Data Integration' module are about the various types of networks that are typically constructed and analyzed in systems biology and systems pharmacology. These lectures start with the idea of functional association networks (FANs). Following this lecture are several lectures that discuss how to construct FANs from various resources and how to use these networks for analyzing gene lists as well as to construct a puzzle that can be used to connect genomic data with phenotypic data. 
681,Crowdsourcing: Microtasks and Megatasks,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,The final set of lectures presents the idea of crowdsourcing. MOOCs provide the opportunity to work together on projects that are difficult to complete alone (microtasks) or compete for implementing the best algorithms to solve hard problems (megatasks). You will have the opportunity to participate in various crowdsourcing projects: microtasks and megatasks. These projects are designed specifically for this course.
682,Final Exam,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/network-biology?specialization=systems-biology,The final exam consists of multiple choice questions from topics covered in all of modules of the course. Some of the questions may require you to perform some of the analysis methods you learned throughout the course on new datasets.
