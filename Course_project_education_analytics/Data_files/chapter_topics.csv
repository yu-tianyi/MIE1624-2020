Or maybe you already have some experience using SQL to query smaller-scale data with relational databases. Either way, if you are interested in gaining the skills necessary to query big data with modern distributed SQL engines, this Specialization is for you.

Most courses that teach SQL focus on traditional relational databases, but today, more and more of the data thatâs being generated is too big to be stored there, and itâs growing too quickly to be efficiently stored in commercial data warehouses. Instead, itâs increasingly stored in distributed clusters and cloud storage. These data stores are cost-efficient and infinitely scalable.

To query these huge datasets in clusters and cloud storage, you need a newer breed of SQL engine: distributed query engines, like Hive, Impala, Presto, and Drill. These are open source SQL engines capable of querying enormous datasets. This Specialization focuses on Hive and Impala, the most widely deployed of these query engines.

304,Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform auf Deutsch Specialization,4,"Was ist maschinelles Lernen und welche Probleme lassen sich damit lÃ¶sen? Was sind die fÃ¼nf Phasen zur Umsetzung eines fÃ¼r ML geeigneten Anwendungsfalls und warum darf keine dieser Phasen Ã¼bersprungen werden? Warum sind neuronale Netze gerade so beliebt? Wie kÃ¶nnen Sie ein Projekt fÃ¼r betreutes Lernen gestalten und mithilfe des Gradientenverfahrens und sinnvoll erstellten Datasets eine gute, generalisierbare LÃ¶sung finden? In diesem Kurs lernen Sie, verteilte Modelle fÃ¼r ML zu schreiben, die in TensorFlow skaliert werden, das Training dieser Modelle horizontal zu skalieren und leistungsstarke Vorhersagen zu erstellen. Wir gehen darauf ein, wie Sie Rohdaten so in Merkmale umwandeln, dass ML wichtige Eigenschaften dieser Daten erlernen kann und menschliche Einblicke in das Problem zulÃ¤sst. SchlieÃlich lernen Sie, die richtige Mischung aus Parametern zu verwenden, um prÃ¤zise und generalisierte Modelle zu erstellen, und Sie erhalten eine EinfÃ¼hrung in die Theorie zum LÃ¶sen bestimmter Arten von ML-Problemen. Auf diese Weise gewinnen Sie ein umfassendes VerstÃ¤ndnis von ML. Zuerst erstellen Sie eine auf ML ausgerichtete Strategie. Dann fahren Sie mit Modelltraining, Optimierung und Produktentwicklung fort.

Was sind die fÃ¼nf Phasen zur Umsetzung eines fÃ¼r ML geeigneten Anwendungsfalls und warum darf keine dieser Phasen Ã¼bersprungen werden? Warum sind neuronale Netze gerade so beliebt? Wie kÃ¶nnen Sie ein Projekt fÃ¼r betreutes Lernen gestalten und mithilfe des Gradientenverfahrens und sinnvoll erstellten Datasets eine gute, generalisierbare LÃ¶sung finden? In diesem Kurs lernen Sie, verteilte Modelle fÃ¼r ML zu schreiben, die in TensorFlow skaliert werden, das Training dieser Modelle horizontal zu skalieren und leistungsstarke Vorhersagen zu erstellen. Wir gehen darauf ein, wie Sie Rohdaten so in Merkmale umwandeln, dass ML wichtige Eigenschaften dieser Daten erlernen kann und menschliche Einblicke in das Problem zulÃ¤sst. SchlieÃlich lernen Sie, die richtige Mischung aus Parametern zu verwenden, um prÃ¤zise und generalisierte Modelle zu erstellen, und Sie erhalten eine EinfÃ¼hrung in die Theorie zum LÃ¶sen bestimmter Arten von ML-Problemen. Auf diese Weise gewinnen Sie ein umfassendes VerstÃ¤ndnis von ML. Zuerst erstellen Sie eine auf ML ausgerichtete Strategie. Dann fahren Sie mit Modelltraining, Optimierung und Produktentwicklung fort.

493,Bioinformatics Specialization,4,"Join Us in a Top 50 MOOC of All Time!

How do we sequence and compare genomes? How do we identify the genetic basis for disease? How do we construct an evolutionary Tree of Life for all species on Earth?

When you complete this Specialization, you will learn how to answer many questions in modern biology that have become inseparable from the computational approaches used to solve them. You will also obtain a toolkit of existing software resources built on these computational approaches and that are used by thousands of biologists every day in one of the fastest growing fields in science.

Although this Specialization centers on computational topics, you do not need to know how to program in order to complete it. If you are interested in programming, we feature an ""Honors Track"" (called ""hacker track"" in previous runs of the course). The Honors Track allows you to implement the bioinformatics algorithms that you will encounter along the way in dozens of automatically graded coding challenges. By completing the Honors Track, you will be a bioinformatics software professional!

584,Development of Secure Embedded Systems Specialization,4,"Three people died after the crash landing of an Asiana Airlines aircraft from Seoul, Korea, at San Fransisco International Airport (SFO) on July 6, 2013. The American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) established that the crash most probably was caused by the flight crew's (in)actions. Three teenage girls lost their lives; two in the airplane and another was accidentally run over by a firetruck.The human factor is often cause for accidents. NTSB and others report that more than 50 percent of plane crashes is caused by pilot error (and for road accidents it is even 90 perc.) Correctly designed safety and security critical systems can prevent these errors.

After following this course successfully, you are able to develop secure embedded systems that are at the core of these safety and security critical systems. You are even challenged to program your own landing guiding system in our capstone project.

If you are interested in building secure embedded systems for the benefit of humanity, this specialization is for you!
