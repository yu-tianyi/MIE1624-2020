Тематическое моделирование — это способ семантического анализа коллекции текстовых документов. Тематическая модель позволяет для каждого документа найти темы, которые его описывают, и кроме того показывает, какие слова характеризуют ту или иную тему. Другими словами, мы находим более компактное представление большого набора текстов в виде нескольких тем. С математической точки зрения тематическая модель — это еще один вид матричного разложения, где в качестве исходной матрицы выступает матрица частот слов в документах.

377,Welcome,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Our course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data.  This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"".<p> In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent.  Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions.  You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations.<p> You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house."
378,Simple Linear Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"The next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions.  <p> More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price').  This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value.  You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms').  You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"".   Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. <p>Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model."
379,Multiple Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Having learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data.  You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing.  <p> This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment.  You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error.  For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance.  This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning.  Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. <p>The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course."
380,Assessing Performance,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"You have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data.   In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue.  This method is called ""ridge regression"".  You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions.  To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective.  You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression.  To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". <p>You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant."
381,Ridge Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"A fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model.  In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions. <p> To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features.  You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms.  Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge.  This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. <p>Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning. "
382,Feature Selection & Lasso,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Up to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset.  In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods.  These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations.  <p> We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set.  This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors.  Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression.  Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point.  You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle.  You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior."
383,Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.  We also briefly discuss some important regression techniques we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.  "
384,Closing Remarks,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world."
385,Welcome!,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Linear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods. For example, in our sentiment analysis case-study, a linear classifier associates a coefficient with the counts of each word in the sentence. In this module, you will become proficient in this type of representation. You will focus on a particularly useful type of linear classifier called logistic regression, which, in addition to allowing you to predict a class, provides a probability associated with the prediction. These probabilities are extremely useful, since they provide a degree of confidence in the predictions. In this module, you will also be able to construct features from categorical inputs, and to tackle classification problems with more than two class (multiclass problems). You will examine the results of these techniques on a real-world product sentiment analysis task."
386,Linear Classifiers & Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Once familiar with linear classifiers and logistic regression, you can now dive in and write your first learning algorithm for classification. In particular, you will use gradient ascent to learn the coefficients of your classifier from data. You first will need to define the quality metric for these tasks using an approach called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). You will also become familiar with a simple technique for selecting the step size for gradient ascent. An optional, advanced part of this module will cover the derivation of the gradient for logistic regression.  You will implement your own learning algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and use it to learn a sentiment analysis classifier."
387,Learning Linear Classifiers,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"As we saw in the regression course, overfitting is perhaps the most significant challenge you will face as you apply machine learning approaches in practice. This challenge can be particularly significant for logistic regression, as you will discover in this module, since we not only risk getting an overly complex decision boundary, but your classifier can also become overly confident about the probabilities it predicts. In this module, you will investigate overfitting in classification in significant detail, and obtain broad practical insights from some interesting visualizations of the classifiers' outputs. You will then add a regularization term to your optimization to mitigate overfitting. You will investigate both L2 regularization to penalize large coefficient values, and L1 regularization to obtain additional sparsity in the coefficients. Finally, you will modify your gradient ascent algorithm to learn regularized logistic regression classifiers. You will implement your own regularized logistic regression classifier from scratch, and investigate the impact of the L2 penalty on real-world sentiment analysis data."
388,Overfitting & Regularization in Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Along with linear classifiers, decision trees are amongst the most widely used classification techniques in the real world. This method is extremely intuitive, simple to implement and provides interpretable predictions. In this module, you will become familiar with the core decision trees representation. You will then design a simple, recursive greedy algorithm to learn decision trees from data. Finally, you will extend this approach to deal with continuous inputs, a fundamental requirement for practical problems. In this module, you will investigate a brand new case-study in the financial sector: predicting the risk associated with a bank loan. You will implement your own decision tree learning algorithm on real loan data."
389,Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Out of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. No practical implementation is possible without including approaches that mitigate this challenge. In this module, through various visualizations and investigations, you will investigate why decision trees suffer from significant overfitting problems. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees. At first, you will design algorithms that stop the learning process before the decision trees become overly complex. In an optional segment, you will design a very practical approach that learns an overly-complex tree, and then simplifies it with pruning. Your implementation will investigate the effect of these techniques on mitigating overfitting on our real-world loan data set. "
390,Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Real-world machine learning problems are fraught with missing data. That is, very often, some of the inputs are not observed for all data points. This challenge is very significant, happens in most cases, and needs to be addressed carefully to obtain great performance. And, this issue is rarely discussed in machine learning courses. In this module, you will tackle the missing data challenge head on. You will start with the two most basic techniques to convert a dataset with missing data into a clean dataset, namely skipping missing values and inputing missing values. In an advanced section, you will also design a modification of the decision tree learning algorithm that builds decisions about missing data right into the model. You will also explore these techniques in your real-data implementation.  "
391,Handling Missing Data,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"One of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting, one of the most important and practical techniques in machine learning today. This simple approach can boost the accuracy of any classifier, and is widely used in practice, e.g., it's used by more than half of the teams who win the Kaggle machine learning competitions. In this module, you will first define the ensemble classifier, where multiple models vote on the best prediction. You will then explore a boosting algorithm called  AdaBoost, which provides a great approach for boosting classifiers. Through visualizations, you will become familiar with many of the practical aspects of this techniques. You will create your very own implementation of AdaBoost, from scratch, and use it to boost the performance of your loan risk predictor on real data. "
392,Boosting,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"In many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. You will explore a case-study that significantly highlights this issue: using sentiment analysis to display positive reviews on a restaurant website. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers. You will explore how the probabilities output by your classifier can be used to trade-off precision with recall, and dive into this spectrum, using precision-recall curves. In your hands-on implementation, you will compute these metrics with your learned classifier on real-world sentiment analysis data."
393,Precision-Recall,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"With the advent of the internet, the growth of social media, and the embedding of sensors in the world, the magnitudes of data that our machine learning algorithms must handle have grown tremendously over the last decade. This effect is sometimes called ""Big Data"". Thus, our learning algorithms must scale to bigger and bigger datasets. In this module, you will develop a small modification of gradient ascent called stochastic gradient, which provides significant speedups in the running time of our algorithms. This simple change can drastically improve scaling, but makes the algorithm less stable and harder to use in practice. In this module, you will investigate the practical techniques needed to make stochastic gradient viable, and to thus to obtain learning algorithms that scale to huge datasets. You will also address a new kind of machine learning problem, online learning, where the data streams in over time, and we must learn the coefficients as the data arrives. This task can also be solved with stochastic gradient. You will implement your very own stochastic gradient ascent algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and evaluate it on sentiment analysis data. "
394,Scaling to Huge Datasets & Online Learning,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world."
395,Welcome,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"We start the course by considering a retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading.  We cast this problem as one of nearest neighbor search, which is a concept we have seen in the Foundations and Regression courses.  However, here, you will take a deep dive into two critical components of the algorithms: the data representation and metric for measuring similarity between pairs of datapoints.  You will examine the computational burden of the naive nearest neighbor search algorithm, and instead implement scalable alternatives using KD-trees for handling large datasets and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for providing approximate nearest neighbors, even in high-dimensional spaces.  You will explore all of these ideas on a Wikipedia dataset, comparing and contrasting the impact of the various choices you can make on the nearest neighbor results produced."
396,Nearest Neighbor Search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets.  Motivated by our document analysis case study, you will use clustering to discover thematic groups of articles by ""topic"".  These topics are not provided in this unsupervised learning task; rather, the idea is to output such cluster labels that can be post-facto associated with known topics like ""Science"", ""World News"", etc.  Even without such post-facto labels, you will examine how the clustering output can provide insights into the relationships between datapoints in the dataset.  The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there.  To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework.  You will show that k-means can provide an interpretable grouping of Wikipedia articles when appropriately tuned."
397,Clustering with k-means,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information.  In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a ""cluster"" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via ""soft assignments"".  You will explore and implement a broadly useful algorithm called expectation maximization (EM) for inferring these soft assignments, as well as the model parameters.  To gain intuition, you will first consider a visually appealing image clustering task.  You will then cluster Wikipedia articles, handling the high-dimensionality of the tf-idf document representation considered."
398,Mixture Models,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"The clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic.  But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics.  In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis.  You will interpret the output of LDA, and various ways the output can be utilized, like as a set of learned document features.  The mixed membership modeling ideas you learn about through LDA for document analysis carry over to many other interesting models and applications, like social network models where people have multiple affiliations.<p>Throughout this module, we introduce aspects of Bayesian modeling and a Bayesian inference algorithm called Gibbs sampling.  You will be able to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA by the end of the module."
399,Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.<p>We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset.  Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series.  We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.

432,Introduction and Overview,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In this module, we define the Bayesian network representation and its semantics. We also analyze the relationship between the graph structure and the independence properties of a distribution represented over that graph. Finally, we give some practical tips on how to model a real-world situation as a Bayesian network."
433,Bayesian Network (Directed Models),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In many cases, we need to model distributions that have a recurring structure. In this module, we describe representations for two such situations. One is temporal scenarios, where we want to model a probabilistic structure that holds constant over time; here, we use Hidden Markov Models, or, more generally, Dynamic Bayesian Networks. The other is aimed at scenarios that involve multiple similar entities, each of whose properties is governed by a similar model; here, we use Plate Models."
434,Template Models for Bayesian Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,A table-based representation of a CPD in a Bayesian network has a size that grows exponentially in the number of parents. There are a variety of other form of CPD that exploit some type of structure in the dependency model to allow for a much more compact representation. Here we describe a number of the ones most commonly used in practice.
435,Structured CPDs for Bayesian Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In this module, we describe Markov networks (also called Markov random fields): probabilistic graphical models based on an undirected graph representation. We discuss the representation of these models and their semantics. We also analyze the independence properties of distributions encoded by these graphs, and their relationship to the graph structure. We compare these independencies to those encoded by a Bayesian network, giving us some insight on which type of model is more suitable for which scenarios."
436,Markov Networks (Undirected Models),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models,"In this module, we discuss the task of decision making under uncertainty. We describe the framework of decision theory, including some aspects of utility functions. We then talk about how decision making scenarios can be encoded as a graphical model called an Influence Diagram, and how such models provide insight both into decision making and the value of information gathering."

We describe the algorithm, and analyze its complexity in terms of properties of the graph structure."
440,Variable Elimination,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,This module describes an alternative view of exact inference in graphical models: that of message passing between clusters each of which encodes a factor over a subset of variables. This framework provides a basis for a variety of exact and approximate inference algorithms. We focus here on the basic framework and on its instantiation in the exact case of clique tree propagation. An optional lesson describes the loopy belief propagation (LBP) algorithm and its properties.
441,Belief Propagation Algorithms ,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"This module describes algorithms for finding the most likely assignment for a distribution encoded as a PGM (a task known as MAP inference). We describe message passing algorithms, which are very similar to the algorithms for computing conditional probabilities, except that we need to also consider how to decode the results to construct a single assignment. In an optional module, we describe a few other algorithms that are able to use very different techniques by exploiting the combinatorial optimization nature of the MAP task."
442,MAP Algorithms,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-2-inference,"In this module, we discuss a class of algorithms that uses random sampling to provide approximate answers to conditional probability queries.

We start with the basic question: does this case sufficiently differ from the sequences? Turns out, yes, it does thanks to significant structural differences between natural and real numbers. One of those differences - the continuousness - allows us to define and calculate limits at finite  moments. We spend some time specifically on the famous important limits, then we proceed with the idea of asymptotic comparison of functions, Big- and little-o notations. To top our module with, we introduce functions of several variables and spend some time getting used to conveniently plot and interpret them, finishing up with discussion of its limits."

This skills could be used for finding approximate values via linear approximation or during the search for extremal values. To provide an understanding of the sufficient condition of the extremum, we introduce the concept of convexity."
516,Derivatives and Linear Approximations: Singlevariate Functions,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"Whilst we have discussed all linear related concepts for single variate functions, it is essential to try and generalise it for the multivariate case. Since the derivative concept is hard to stretch directly, we start with the idea of linear approximation and tangent plane; thus we introduce partial derivatives and the differentiability. We separately spend sometime discussing neural network inspired composite multivariate functions and all-mighty chain rule. Our generalisation attempt finalised with the idea of convexity in terms of the second partial derivatives."
517,Derivatives and Linear Approximations: Multivariate Functions,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"As we introduced the operation of differentiation, it is essential to think about the inverse procedure - the integration. We start the module with basic definition of the integration and, as usual, all techniques required to calculate wide range of the indefinite integrals, stressing out that the result is not guaranteed now. Then we proceed with the idea and formal definition of area under curve and its relation to the indefinite case - the fundamental theorem of calculus. We finish our week with the discussion of the areas of infinite figures (improper integrals) and numerical methods to assess the value of the definite integral."
518,"Integrals: Anti-derivative, Area under Curve",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"As we built up impressive base by introducing various estimations of change and overall function's behaviour, it is essential to speak about general idea of the optimisation procedure. Since we already tackled it in a single variate case, we try to generalise our principles of necessary and sufficient conditions to the case of multivariate functions. Whilst it provides theoretical understanding, one should seek for faster iterative way to find an extremal point. In order to do it, we start our week with the concept of the directional derivative in order to provide and understanding of the desired direction of iterative search. Thus we produce the idea and motivation of the gradient descent, the last  and final concept in our course you are asked to master."

Specifically, we're going to use prediction models to try to predict how the financial statements would look if there were no manipulation by the manager. First, we’ll look at Discretionary Accruals Models, which try to model the non-cash portion of earnings or ""accruals,"" where managers are making estimates to calculate revenues or expenses. Next, we'll talk about Discretionary Expenditure Models, which try to model the cash portion of earnings. Then we'll look at Fraud Prediction Models, which try to directly predict what types of companies are likely to commit frauds. Finally, we’ll explore something called Benford's Law, which examines the frequency with which certain numbers appear. If certain numbers appear more often than dictated by Benford's Law, it's an indication that the financial statements were potentially manipulated. These models represent the state of the art right now, and are what academics use to try to detect and predict earnings management. By the end of this module, you'll have a very strong tool kit that will help you try to detect financial statements that may have been manipulated by managers."

In this module, we’ll examine how to uncover which non-financial performance measures predict financial results through asking fundamental questions, such as: of the hundreds of non-financial measures, which are the key drivers of financial success? How do you rank or weight non-financial measures which don’t share a common denominator?  What performance targets are desirable? Finally, we’ll look at some comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting analytics to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off in the future, and finish with some important organizational issues that commonly arise using these models. By the end of this module, you’ll know how predictive analytics can be used to determine what you should be measuring, how to weight very, very different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results, how to make trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives, and how to set performance targets for optimal financial performance."

752,Transfer Learning,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,Welcome to week 2 of the course! In week 1 you learned all about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning is a new programming paradigm. This week you’re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code! Check out this conversation between Laurence and Andrew where they discuss it and introduce you to Computer Vision!
753,Multiclass Classifications,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"Welcome to week 3! In week 2 you saw a basic Neural Network for Computer Vision. It did the job nicely, but it was a little naive in its approach. This week we’ll see how to make it better, as discussed by Laurence and Andrew here. "
754,Sentiment in text,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"Last week you saw how to improve the results from your deep neural network using convolutions. It was a good start, but the data you used was very basic. What happens when your images are larger, or if the features aren’t always in the same place? Andrew and Laurence discuss this to prepare you for what you’ll learn this week: handling complex images!"

756,Sequence models,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"You've heard the term overfitting a number of times to this point. Overfitting is simply the concept of being over specialized in training -- namely that your model is very good at classifying what it is trained for, but not so good at classifying things that it hasn't seen. In order to generalize your model more effectively, you will of course need a greater breadth of samples to train it on. That's not always possible, but a nice potential shortcut to this is Image Augmentation, where you tweak the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers. You'll learn all about that this week!"
757,Sequence models and literature,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as you've seen, you can be limited by the data you have on hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively. Transfer learning can help solve this -- where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that you can either use them directly, or, you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario. This is Transfer learning, and you'll look into that this week!"
758,Sequences and Prediction,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,"You've come a long way, Congratulations! One more thing to do before we move off of ConvNets to the next module, and that's to go beyond binary classification. Each of the examples you've done so far involved classifying one thing or another -- horse or human, cat or dog. When moving beyond binary into Categorical classification there are some coding considerations you need to take into account. You'll look at them this week!"

760,Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,"Last week you saw how to use the Tokenizer to prepare your text to be used by a neural network by converting words into numeric tokens, and sequencing sentences from these tokens. This week you'll learn about Embeddings, where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space. With Embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space. This will begin the process of training a neural network to udnerstand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings."
761,Real-world time series data,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction,"In the last couple of weeks you looked first at Tokenizing words to get numeric values from them, and then using Embeddings to group words of similar meaning depending on how they were labelled. This gave you a good, but rough, sentiment analysis -- words such as 'fun' and 'entertaining' might show up in a positive movie review, and 'boring' and 'dull' might show up in a negative one. But sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear. For example, you could have 'not fun', which of course is the opposite of 'fun'. This week you'll start digging into a variety of model formats that are used in training models to understand context in sequence!"
762,Introduction to Linear Algebra and to Mathematics for Machine Learning,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"Taking everything that you've learned in training a neural network based on NLP, we thought it might be a bit of fun to turn the tables away from classification and use your knowledge for prediction. Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once you've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, this week you'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of it's own!"

767,What is calculus?,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"deeplearning.ai is Andrew Ng's new venture which amongst others, strives for providing comprehensive AI education beyond borders."
768,Multivariate calculus,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"In this module, we look at operations we can do with vectors - finding the modulus (size), angle between vectors (dot or inner product) and projections of one vector onto another. We can then examine how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes - the basis. That will then let us determine whether a proposed set of basis vectors are what's called 'linearly independent.' This will complete our examination of vectors, allowing us to move on to matrices in module 3 and then start to solve linear algebra problems."
769,Multivariate chain rule and its applications,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Now that we've looked at vectors, we can turn to matrices.  First we look at how to use matrices as tools to solve linear algebra problems, and as objects that transform vectors. Then we look at how to solve systems of linear equations using matrices, which will then take us on to look at inverse matrices and determinants, and to think about what the determinant really is, intuitively speaking. Finally, we'll look at cases of special matrices that mean that the determinant is zero or where the matrix isn't invertible - cases where algorithms that need to invert a matrix will fail."
770,Taylor series and linearisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"In Module 4, we continue our discussion of matrices; first we think about how to code up matrix multiplication and matrix operations using the Einstein Summation Convention, which is a widely used notation in more advanced linear algebra courses. Then, we look at how matrices can transform a description of a vector from one basis (set of axes) to another. This will allow us to, for example, figure out how to apply a reflection to an image and manipulate images. We'll also look at how to construct a convenient basis vector set in order to do such transformations. Then, we'll write some code to do these transformations and apply this work computationally."
771,Intro to optimisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Eigenvectors are particular vectors that are unrotated by a transformation matrix, and eigenvalues are the amount by which the eigenvectors are stretched. These special 'eigen-things' are very useful in linear algebra and will let us examine Google's famous PageRank algorithm for presenting web search results. Then we'll apply this in code, which will wrap up the course."

Our online courses are designed to promote interactivity, learning and the development of core skills, through the use of cutting-edge digital technology."
773,Statistics of Datasets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"Building on the foundations of the previous module, we now generalise our calculus tools to handle multivariable systems. This means we can take a function with multiple inputs and determine the influence of each of them separately. It would not be unusual for a machine learning method to require the analysis of a function with thousands of inputs, so we will also introduce the linear algebra structures necessary for storing the results of our multivariate calculus analysis in an orderly fashion.  "
774,Inner Products,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"Having seen that multivariate calculus is really no more complicated than the univariate case, we now focus on applications of the chain rule. Neural networks are one of the most popular and successful conceptual structures in machine learning. They are build up from a connected web of neurons and inspired by the structure of biological brains. The behaviour of each neuron is influenced by a set of control parameters, each of which needs to be optimised to best fit the data. The multivariate chain rule can be used to calculate the influence of each parameter of the networks, allow them to be updated during training. "
775,Orthogonal Projections,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"The Taylor series is a method for re-expressing functions as polynomial series. This approach is the rational behind the use of simple linear approximations to complicated functions. In this module, we will derive the formal expression for the univariate Taylor series and discuss some important consequences of this result relevant to machine learning. Finally, we will discuss the multivariate case and see how the Jacobian and the Hessian come in to play. "
776,Principal Component Analysis,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"If we want to find the minimum and maximum points of a function then we can use multivariate calculus to do this, say to optimise the parameters  (the space) of a function to fit some data.  First we’ll do this in one dimension and use the gradient to give us estimates of where the zero points of that function are, and then iterate in the Newton-Raphson method.  Then we’ll extend the idea to multiple dimensions by finding the gradient vector, Grad, which is the vector of the Jacobian.  This will then let us find our way to the minima and maxima in what is called the gradient descent method.  We’ll then take a moment to use Grad to find the minima and maxima along a constraint in the space, which is the Lagrange multipliers method."
777,Programming Challenges,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In order to optimise the fitting parameters of a fitting function to the best fit for some data, we need a way to define how good our fit is.  This goodness of fit is called chi-squared, which we’ll first apply to fitting a straight line - linear regression.  Then we’ll look at how to optimise our fitting function using chi-squared in the general case using the gradient descent method. Finally, we’ll look at how to do this easily in Python in just a few lines of code, which will wrap up the course."

779,Greedy Algorithms,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"Data can be interpreted as vectors. Vectors allow us to talk about geometric concepts, such as lengths, distances and angles to characterise similarity between vectors. This will become important later in the course when we discuss PCA. In this module, we will introduce and practice the concept of an inner product. Inner products allow us to talk about geometric concepts in vector spaces. More specifically, we will start with the dot product (which we may still know from school) as a special case of an inner product, and then move toward a more general concept of an inner product, which play an integral part in some areas of machine learning, such as kernel machines (this includes support vector machines and Gaussian processes). We have a lot of exercises in this module to practice and understand the concept of inner products."
780,Divide-and-Conquer,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module, we will look at orthogonal projections of vectors, which live in a high-dimensional vector space, onto lower-dimensional subspaces. This will play an important role in the next module when we derive PCA. We will start off with a geometric motivation of what an orthogonal projection is and work our way through the corresponding derivation. We will end up with a single equation that allows us to project any vector onto a lower-dimensional subspace. However, we will also understand how this equation came about. As in the other modules, we will have both pen-and-paper practice and a small programming example with a jupyter notebook."
781,Dynamic Programming 1,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"We can think of dimensionality reduction as a way of compressing data with some loss, similar to jpg or mp3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental dimensionality reduction techniques that are used in machine learning. In this module, we use the results from the first three modules of this course and derive PCA from a geometric point of view. Within this course, this module is the most challenging one, and we will go through an explicit derivation of PCA plus some coding exercises that will make us a proficient user of PCA. "

783,Basic Data Structures,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will learn about seemingly naïve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges."
784,Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using naïve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!"
785,Priority Queues and Disjoint Sets,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text. "

789,Decomposition of Graphs 1,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"We start this module by considering priority queues which are used to efficiently schedule jobs, either in the context of a computer operating system or in real life, to sort huge files, which is the most important building block for any Big Data processing algorithm, and to efficiently compute shortest paths in graphs, which is a topic we will cover in our next course. For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient. By completing this module, you will be able to implement both these data structures efficiently from scratch."
790,Decomposition of Graphs 2,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will learn about very powerful and widely used technique called hashing. Its applications include implementation of programming languages, file systems, pattern search, distributed key-value storage and many more. You will learn how to implement data structures to store and modify sets of objects and mappings from one type of objects to another one. You will see that naive implementations either consume huge amount of memory or are slow, and then you will learn to implement hash tables that use linear memory and work in O(1) on average! In the end, you will learn how hash functions are used in modern disrtibuted systems and how they are used to optimize storage of services like Dropbox, Google Drive and Yandex Disk!"
791,Paths in Graphs 1,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets.

795,Suffix Trees,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will study algorithms for finding Shortest Paths in Graphs. These algorithms have lots of applications. When you launch a navigation app on your smartphone like Google Maps or Yandex.Navi, it uses these algorithms to find you the fastest route from work to home, from home to school, etc. When you search for airplane tickets, these algorithms are used to find a route with the minimum number of plane changes. Unexpectedly, these algorithms can also be used to determine the optimal way to do currency exchange, sometimes allowing to earh huge profit! We will cover all these applications, and you will learn Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm. These algorithms are efficient and lay the foundation for even more efficient algorithms which you will learn and implement in the Shortest Paths Capstone Project to find best routes on real maps of cities and countries, find distances between people in Social Networks.

However, some of the results Pavel mentioned remain mysterious: e.g., how can we perform exact pattern matching in O(|Text|) time rather than in O(|Text|*|Pattern|) time as in the naïve brute force algorithm? How can it be that matching a 1000-nucleotide pattern against the human genome is nearly as fast as matching a 3-nucleotide pattern??? Also, even though Pavel showed how to quickly construct the suffix array given the suffix tree, he has not revealed the magic behind the fast algorithms for the suffix tree construction!In this module, Miсhael will address some algorithmic challenges that Pavel tried to hide from you :) such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for exact pattern matching and more efficient algorithms for suffix tree and suffix array construction."

Note that if your research question only includes quantitative variables, you can categorize those just to get some practice with the tool. "
1030,Logistic Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"This session shows you how to test hypotheses in the context of a Pearson Correlation (when you have two quantitative variables). Your task will be to write a program that manages any additional variables you may need and runs and interprets a correlation coefficient. Note that if your research question only includes categorical variables, you can choose other variables from your data set just to get some practice with the tool. "
1031,Decision Trees,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will discuss the basic concept of statistical interaction (also known as moderation). In statistics, moderation occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. The effect of a moderating variable is often characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a third variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between your explanatory (X) and response (Y) variable. Your task will be to test your own research question in the context of one or more potential moderating variables. "
1032,Random Forests,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"At Wesleyan, distinguished scholar-teachers work closely with students, taking advantage of fluidity among disciplines to explore the world with a variety of tools.

1033,Lasso Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we discuss more about the importance of testing for confounding, and provide examples of situations in which a confounding variable can explain the association between an explanatory and response variable. In addition, now that you have statistically tested the association between an explanatory variable and your response variable, you will test and interpret this association using basic linear regression analysis for a quantitative response variable. You will also learn about how the linear regression model can be used to predict your observed response variable. Finally, we will also discuss the statistical assumptions underlying the linear regression model, and show you some best practices for coding your explanatory variablesNote that if your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use one from your data set just to get some practice with the tool."
1034,K-Means Cluster Analysis,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"Multiple regression analysis is tool that allows you to expand on your research question, and conduct a more rigorous test of the association between your explanatory and response variable by adding additional quantitative and/or categorical explanatory variables to your linear regression model. In this session, you will apply and interpret a multiple regression analysis for a quantitative response variable, and will learn how to use confidence intervals to take into account error in estimating a population parameter. You will also learn how to account for nonlinear associations in a linear regression model. Finally, you will develop experience using regression diagnostic techniques to evaluate how well your multiple regression model predicts your observed response variable. Note that if you have not yet identified additional explanatory variables, you should choose at least one additional explanatory variable from your data set. When you go back to your codebooks, ask yourself a few questions like “What other variables might explain the association between my explanatory and response variable?”; “What other variables might explain more of the variability in my response variable?”, or even “What other explanatory variables might be interesting to explore?” Additional explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical, or both. Although you need only two explanatory variables to test a multiple regression model, we encourage you to identify more than one additional explanatory variable. Doing so will really allow you to experience the power of multiple regression analysis, and will increase your confidence in your ability to test and interpret more complex regression models. If your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use the same quantitative response variable that you used in Module 2, or you may choose another one from your data set."
1035,Information Systems,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-database,"In this session, we will discuss some things that you should keep in mind as you continue to use data analysis in the future. We will also teach also you how to test a categorical explanatory variable with more than two categories in a multiple regression analysis. Finally, we introduce you to logistic regression analysis for a binary response variable with multiple explanatory variables. Logistic regression is simply another form of the linear regression model, so the basic idea is the same as a multiple regression analysis. But, unlike the multiple regression model, the logistic regression model is designed to test binary response variables. You will gain experience testing and interpreting a logistic regression model, including using odds ratios and confidence intervals to determine the magnitude of the association between your explanatory variables and response variable.   You can use the same explanatory variables that you used to test your multiple regression model with a quantitative outcome, but your response variable needs to be binary (categorical with 2 categories). If you have a quantitative response variable, you will have to bin it into 2 categories. Alternatively, you can choose a different binary response variable from your data set that you can use to test a logistic regression model. If you have a categorical response variable with more than two categories, you will need to collapse it into two categories."
1036,Entity Relationship Theory and Conceptual Design,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-database,"At Wesleyan, distinguished scholar-teachers work closely with students, taking advantage of fluidity among disciplines to explore the world with a variety of tools. The university seeks to build a diverse, energetic community of students, faculty, and staff who think critically and creatively and who value independence of mind and generosity of spirit."
1037,Relational Database Theory and Logical Design,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-database,"In this session, you will learn about random forests, a type of data mining algorithm that can select from among a large number of variables those that are most important in determining the target or response variable to be explained. Unlike decision trees, the results of random forests generalize well to new data."
1038,Structured Query Language Data Manipulation Language,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-database,"Lasso regression analysis is a shrinkage and variable selection method for linear regression models. The goal of lasso regression is to obtain the subset of predictors that minimizes prediction error for a quantitative response variable. The lasso does this by imposing a constraint on the model parameters that causes regression coefficients for some variables to shrink toward zero. Variables with a regression coefficient equal to zero after the shrinkage process are excluded from the model. Variables with non-zero regression coefficients variables are most strongly associated with the response variable. Explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical or both. In this session, you will apply and interpret a lasso regression analysis. You will also develop experience using k-fold cross validation to select the best fitting model and obtain a more accurate estimate of your model’s test error rate. To test a lasso regression model, you will need to identify a quantitative response variable from your data set if you haven’t already done so, and choose a few additional quantitative and categorical predictor (i.e. explanatory) variables to develop a larger pool of predictors.  Having a larger pool of predictors to test will maximize your experience with lasso regression analysis. Remember that lasso regression is a machine learning method, so your choice of additional predictors does not necessarily need to depend on a research hypothesis or theory. Take some chances, and try some new variables. The lasso regression analysis will help you determine which of your predictors are most important. Note also that if you are working with a relatively small data set, you do not need to split your data into training and test data sets. The cross-validation method you apply is designed to eliminate the need to split your data when you have a limited number of observations."
1039,Structured Query Language and Advanced SQL Programming,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-database,"Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning method that partitions the observations in a data set into a smaller set of clusters where each observation belongs to only one cluster. The goal of cluster analysis is to group, or cluster, observations into subsets based on their similarity of responses on multiple variables. Clustering variables should be primarily quantitative variables, but binary variables may also be included. In this session, we will show you how to use k-means cluster analysis to identify clusters of observations in your data set. You will gain experience in interpreting cluster analysis results by using graphing methods to help you determine the number of clusters to interpret, and examining clustering variable means to evaluate the cluster profiles. Finally, you will get the opportunity to validate your cluster solution by examining differences between clusters on a variable not included in your cluster analysis.  You can use the same variables that you have used in past weeks as clustering variables. If most or all of your previous explanatory variables are categorical, you should identify some additional quantitative clustering variables from your data set. Ideally, most of your clustering variables will be quantitative, although you may also include some binary variables. In addition, you will need to identify a quantitative or binary response variable from your data set that you will not include in your cluster analysis. You will use this variable to validate your clusters by evaluating whether your clusters differ significantly on this response variable using statistical methods, such as analysis of variance or chi-square analysis, which you learned about in Course 2 of the specialization (Data Analysis Tools). Note also that if you are working with a relatively small data set, you do not need to split your data into training and test data sets."

1162, Monte Carlo Methods for Prediction & Control,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"When you’re presented with a problem in industry, the first and most important step is to translate that problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The quality of your solution depends heavily on how well you do this translation. This week, you will learn the definition of MDPs, you will understand goal-directed behavior and how this can be obtained from maximizing scalar rewards, and you will also understand the difference between episodic and continuing tasks. For this week’s graded assessment, you will create three example tasks of your own that fit into the MDP framework. "

We’re an Alberta-based research institute that pushes the bounds of academic knowledge and guides business understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
1167,On-policy Prediction with Approximation,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation,"This week, you will learn about one of the most fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning: temporal difference (TD) learning. TD learning combines some of the features of both Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. TD methods are similar to Monte Carlo methods in that they can learn from the agent’s interaction with the world, and do not require knowledge of the model. TD methods are similar to DP methods in that they bootstrap, and thus can learn online---no waiting until the end of an episode. You will see how TD can learn more efficiently than Monte Carlo, due to bootstrapping. For this module, we first focus on TD for prediction, and discuss TD for control in the next module. This week, you will implement TD to estimate the value function for a fixed policy, in a simulated domain. "
1168,Constructing Features for Prediction,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation,"This week, you will learn about using temporal difference learning for control, as a generalized policy iteration strategy. You will see three different algorithms based on bootstrapping and Bellman equations for control: Sarsa, Q-learning and Expected Sarsa. You will see some of the differences between the methods for on-policy and off-policy control, and that Expected Sarsa is a unified algorithm for both. You will implement Expected Sarsa and Q-learning, on Cliff World. "
1169,Control with Approximation ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation,"Up until now, you might think that learning with and without a model are two distinct, and in some ways, competing strategies: planning with Dynamic Programming verses sample-based learning via TD methods. This week we unify these two strategies with the Dyna architecture. You will learn how to estimate the model from data and then use this model to generate hypothetical experience (a bit like dreaming) to dramatically improve sample efficiency compared to sample-based methods like Q-learning. In addition, you will learn how to design learning systems that are robust to inaccurate models. "

1172,Milestone 1: Formalize Word Problem as MDP,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/complete-reinforcement-learning-system,"The features used to construct the agent’s value estimates are perhaps the most crucial part of a successful learning system. In this module we discuss two basic strategies for constructing features: (1) fixed basis that form an exhaustive partition of the input, and (2) adapting the features while the agent interacts with the world via Neural Networks and Backpropagation. In this week’s graded assessment you will solve a simple but infinite state prediction task with a Neural Network and TD learning.  "
1173,Milestone 2: Choosing The Right Algorithm,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/complete-reinforcement-learning-system,"This week, you will see that the concepts and tools introduced in modules two and three allow straightforward extension of classic TD control methods to the function approximation setting. In particular, you will learn how to find the optimal policy in infinite-state MDPs by simply combining semi-gradient TD methods with generalized policy iteration, yielding classic control methods like Q-learning, and Sarsa. We conclude with a discussion of a new problem formulation for RL---average reward---which will undoubtedly be used in many applications of RL in the future. "
1174,Milestone 3: Identify Key Performance Parameters,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/complete-reinforcement-learning-system,"Every algorithm you have learned about so far estimates a value function as an intermediate step towards the goal of finding an optimal policy. An alternative strategy is to directly learn the parameters of the policy. This week you will learn about these policy gradient methods, and their advantages over value-function based methods. You will also learn how policy gradient methods can be used to find the optimal policy in tasks with both continuous state and action spaces."

Price momentum is similar to momentum in physics, where mass multiplied by velocity determines the persistence with which an object will follow its current path (like a heavy train on a track). In financial markets, however, momentum is determined by other factors like trading volume and rate of price changes. Momentum traders bet that an asset price that is moving strongly in a given direction will continue to move in that direction until the trend loses strength or reverses. This module teaches you all about momentum trading. "

В этом модуле вы узнаете, как описывать результаты регрессионного анализа: как проверить статистическую значимость модели в целом или ее коэффициентов, оценить качество подгонки. У линейных моделей (вернее, у статистических тестов, которые для них используются), как у любого метода, есть свои ограничения. Вы узнаете, что это за ограничения и откуда они возникают. Графические методы диагностики, которыми мы будем пользоваться, универсальны для разных линейных моделей - больше практики поможет вам увереннее принимать решения. Разобравшись со всем этим, вы сможете написать на языке R полный скрипт для подбора, диагностики и представления результатов простой линейной регрессии."
1442,Однофакторный дисперсионный анализ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/lineyniye-modeli-s-diskretnimi-prediktorami?specialization=prosto-o-statistike,"В этом модуле мы с вами погрузимся в самое сердце линейных моделей. Для этого вам придется изучить или вспомнить основы линейной алгебры. Мы обсудим разновидности матриц, способы их создания в R и основные операции с ними. Все это нам понадобится, чтобы разобраться, как устроена линейная регрессия изнутри. Вы узнаете, что такое модельная матрица, научитесь записывать уравнение линейной регрессии в виде матриц и находить его коэффициенты. Вы своими глазами увидите хэт-матрицу, которая позволяет получать предсказанные значения, и даже сможете ее вычислить вручную. Наконец, вы научитесь рассчитывать остаточную дисперсию, вариационно-ковариационную матрицу и использовать все это для того, чтобы строить доверительную зону регрессии. Потом эти знания помогут вам разобраться с устройством более сложных моделей: с дискретными предикторами, с другими распределениями остатков, с иным устройством вариационно-ковариационной матрицы."
1443,Многофакторный дисперсионный анализ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/lineyniye-modeli-s-diskretnimi-prediktorami?specialization=prosto-o-statistike,"Чаще всего связи между величинами устроены сложнее, чем это можно описать при помощи простой линейной регрессии. Множественная линейная регрессия используется, чтобы описать, как переменная-отклик зависит от нескольких предикторов. С появлением в модели множества предикторов у линейной регрессии появляется новое условие применимости - требование отсутствия мультиколлинеарности. В этом модуле вы узнаете, как можно выявить мультиколлинеарность и избежать ее. Наконец, нередко во множественных моделях переменных больше, чем это можно изобразить на плоскости, поэтому мы научим вас простым приемам, которые помогут создавать информативные графики даже в таком случае."

Вы узнаете, как сравнение вложенных моделей при помощи частного F-теста используется при проверке значимости отдельных предикторов или их групп. Более сложные модели лучше описывают исходные данные, но избыточное усложнение опасно, т.к. такие модели начинают давать плохие предсказания на новых данных. При помощи частных F-тестов можно упрощать модели, постепенно исключая незначимые предикторы. Упрощенные модели легче использовать для интерпретации и представления  результатов. Все, что вы успели узнать о линейной регрессии, вы сможете применить, выполнив проект по анализу данных, где нужно будет корректно построить оптимальную множественную линейную модель и представить ее результаты в отчете, написанном при помощи rmarkdown и knitr."

В этом модуле вы научитесь строить и описывать линейные модели для анализа такого рода данных. Мы будем использовать технику сравнения вложенных моделей при помощи частного F-критерия для того, чтобы из сложной модели со множеством взаимодействий получить более простую. Наконец, вы увидите, что интерпретация моделей, в которых есть значимое взаимодействие, значительно упрощается, если можно построить график их предсказаний."

На самом деле, эту же задачу можно эффективно решить, оставаясь в рамках линейных моделей - при помощи дисперсионного анализа. Этот метод позволяет одновременно искать различия между множеством групп, заданных множеством дискретных факторов. В этом модуле вы познакомитесь с устройством однофакторного дисперсионного анализа и научитесь не только тестировать с его помощью значимость влияния дискретных факторов, но и выяснять при помощи пост хок тестов, с различиями каких именно групп связано это влияние."

В этом модуле мы подробно обсудим проблему взаимодействия дискретных факторов, возникающую в такого рода анализах. Далее мы обсудим анализ данных с разным числом наблюдений в группах. Вы узнаете, что результаты дисперсионного анализа таких несбалансированных данных зависят от порядка тестирования гипотез, и в определенных случаях важно выбрать правильный способ параметризации линейной модели. Наконец, мы расскажем вам о трюке, который можно использовать для проведения пост хок теста для взаимодействия факторов в R. Закрепить свои знания об анализе линейных моделей, включающих дискретные предикторы, вы сможете, выполнив проект по анализу данных.

1596,"Practice, Ethics & Integrity",9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"Science is all about gaining knowledge, coming up with the best possible explanations of the world around us. So how do we decide which explanation is the best one? How do we make sure our explanations are accurate? How do we determine we actually know something? In science we try to resolve these questions by using a set of principles and procedures called the scientific method. You need to know its historical and philosophical  'origin story' to really understand the scientific method and to fully appreciate how hard it is to apply the scientific method in the social and behavioral sciences!"
1597,Catch Up,9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"In the first module we discussed how the scientific method developed, general philosophical approaches and the types of knowledge science aims to find. In this second module we'll make these abstract principles and concepts a little more concrete by discussing the empirical cycle and causality in more detail. We’ll see how, and in what order these concepts are implemented when we conduct a research study. We'll also consider the main criteria for evaluating the methodological quality of a research study: Validity and reliability. The focus will be on internal validity and how internal validity can be threatened."
1598,Exam Time!,9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"In the previous module we discussed the empirical cycle, causality and the criteria for methodological quality, focusing on threats to internal validity. In this module we'll consider the most frequently used research designs and we'll see how they address threats to internal validity. We'll look at experimental, quasi-experimental and correlational designs, as well as some other designs you should be familiar with. To understand and appreciate these designs we will discuss some general concepts such as randomization and matching in a little more detail."
1599,Philosophy of Qualitative Research,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"Choosing a design is only the first step in the deduction phase (remember the empirical cycle?). The second step is deciding on specific ways to measure the variables of interest and disinterest. This step is extremely important, because even if we are able to perform a true double-blind experiment, if our measurement and manipulation method are of poor quality, then internal validity will still be compromised! 

In this module we'll look at what measurement is exactly and what the criteria for evaluating measurement are. We will also look more in-depth at self-report measures, including survey, questionnaires and tests. These methods are among the most frequently used measurement instruments in the social and behavioral sciences."
1600,Observation,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"In the previous two modules we discussed research designs and methods to measure and manipulate our variables of interest and disinterest. Before a researcher can move on to the testing phase and can actually collect data, there is just one more procedure that needs to be decided on: Sampling. Researchers need to determine who potential participants are and how they will be selected and recruited. "
1601,Good Practices & Criteria,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"In this last content module we will focus on the part of the research process that follows data collection. The specifics of storing data and using statistics form a course topic in their own right (see the specialization courses on Basic and Inferential Statistics). For now we will focus on more general issues to do with data, interpretation and dissemination of results that relate to ethics and integrity. Some of the concepts that we discuss here will be familiar if you watched the interviews of the past modules. It might be interesting to (re-)watch these if you have the time!"
1602,Qualitative Interviewing,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"In this module there's no new material to study.

In this second module we'll discuss observation as an important method within qualitative research. What types of observation are there? How do we observe? And how do we analyse and describe our data? "
1606,Exam week,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods?specialization=social-science,"What makes qualitative research 'good' is a rather difficult question. Different criteria are suggested, but within the field of qualitative research there is not much agreement on these criteria. However, there is quite some agreement on what good practices of qualitative research are. In this module we will start in lesson 1 with a  discussion of  good practices of qualitative research."
1607,Before we get started...,9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics?specialization=social-science,In this module we'll look at what a qualitative interview entails by trying to define it and by discussing different forms of interviewing behaviour.

1613,Confidence Intervals,9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics?specialization=social-science,"In this first module, we’ll introduce the basic concepts of descriptive statistics. We’ll talk about cases and variables, and we’ll explain how you can order them in a so-called data matrix. We’ll discuss various levels of measurement and we’ll show you how you can present your data by means of tables and graphs. We’ll also introduce measures of central tendency (like mode, median and mean) and dispersion (like range, interquartile range, variance and standard deviation). We’ll not only tell you how to interpret them; we’ll also explain how you can compute them. Finally, we’ll tell you more about z-scores. In this module we’ll only discuss situations in which we analyze one single variable. This is what we call univariate analysis. In the next module we will also introduce studies in which more variables are involved."
1614,Significance Tests,9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics?specialization=social-science,In this second module we’ll look at bivariate analyses: studies with two variables. First we’ll introduce the concept of correlation. We’ll investigate contingency tables (when it comes to categorical variables) and scatterplots (regarding quantitative variables). We’ll also learn how to understand and compute one of the most frequently used measures of correlation: Pearson's r. In the next part of the module we’ll introduce the method of OLS regression analysis. We’ll explain how you (or the computer) can find the regression line and how you can describe this line by means of an equation. We’ll show you that you can assess how well the regression line fits your data by means of the so-called r-squared. We conclude the module with a discussion of why you should always be very careful when interpreting the results of a regression analysis.     
1615,Exam time!,9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics?specialization=social-science,"This module introduces concepts from probability theory and the rules for calculating with probabilities. This is not only useful for answering various kinds of applied statistical questions but also to understand the statistical analyses that will be introduced in subsequent modules. We start by describing randomness, and explain how random events surround us. Next, we provide an intuitive definition of probability through an example and relate this to the concepts of events, sample space and random trials. A graphical tool to understand these concepts is introduced here as well, the tree-diagram.Thereafter a number of concepts from set theory are explained and related to probability calculations. Here the relation is made to tree-diagrams again, as well as contingency tables. We end with a lesson where conditional probabilities, independence and Bayes rule are explained. All in all, this is quite a theoretical module on a topic that is not always easy to grasp. That's why we have included as many intuitive examples as possible."
1616,Before we get started...,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics?specialization=social-science,"Probability distributions form the core of many statistical calculations. They are used as mathematical models to represent some random phenomenon and subsequently answer statistical questions about that phenomenon. This module starts by explaining the basic properties of a probability distribution, highlighting how it quantifies a random variable and also pointing out how it differs between discrete and continuous random variables. Subsequently the cumulative probability distribution is introduced and its properties and usage are explained as well. In a next lecture it is shown how a random variable with its associated probability distribution can be characterized by statistics like a mean and variance, just like observational data. The effects of changing random variables by multiplication or addition on these statistics are explained as well.The lecture thereafter introduces the normal distribution, starting by explaining its functional form and some general properties. Next, the basic usage of the normal distribution to calculate probabilities is explained. And in a final lecture the binomial distribution, an important probability distribution for discrete data, is introduced and further explained. By the end of this module you have covered quite some ground and have a solid basis to answer the most frequently encountered statistical questions. Importantly, the fundamental knowledge about probability distributions that is presented here will also provide a solid basis to learn about inferential statistics in the next modules."
1617,Comparing two groups,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics?specialization=social-science,"Methods for summarizing sample data are called descriptive statistics. However, in most studies we’re not interested in samples, but in underlying populations. If we employ data obtained from a sample to draw conclusions about a wider population, we are using methods of inferential statistics. It is therefore of essential importance that you know how you should draw samples. In this module we’ll pay attention to good sampling methods as well as some poor practices. To draw conclusions about the population a sample is from, researchers make use of a probability distribution that is very important in the world of statistics: the sampling distribution. We’ll discuss sampling distributions in great detail and compare them to data distributions and population distributions. We’ll look at the sampling distribution of the sample mean and the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. "
1618,Categorical association,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics?specialization=social-science,"We can distinguish two types of statistical inference methods. We can: (1) estimate population parameters; and (2) test hypotheses about these parameters. In this module we’ll talk about the first type of inferential statistics: estimation by means of a confidence interval. A confidence interval is a range of numbers, which, most likely, contains the actual population value. The  probability that the interval actually contains the population value is what we call the confidence level. In this module we’ll show you how you can construct confidence intervals for means and proportions and how you should interpret them. We’ll also pay attention to how you can decide how large your sample size should be."
1619,Simple regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics?specialization=social-science,"In this module we’ll talk about statistical hypotheses. They form the main ingredients of the method of significance testing. An hypothesis is nothing more than an expectation about a population. When we conduct a significance test, we use (just like when we construct a confidence interval) sample data to draw inferences about population parameters. The significance test is, therefore, also a method of inferential statistics. We’ll show that each significance test is based on two hypotheses:  the null hypothesis and  the alternative hypothesis. When you do a significance test, you assume that the null hypothesis is true unless your data provide strong evidence against it. We’ll show you how you can conduct a significance test about a mean and how you can conduct a test about a proportion. We’ll also demonstrate that significance tests and confidence intervals are closely related. We conclude the module by arguing that you can make right and wrong decisions while doing a test. Wrong decisions are referred to as Type I and Type II errors."
1620,Multiple regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics?specialization=social-science,"This is the final module, where you can apply everything you've learned until now in the final exam.

European Research Universities and also maintains intensive contact with
other leading research universities around the world."
1622,Non-parametric tests,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics?specialization=social-science,"In this second module of week 1 we dive right in with a quick refresher on statistical hypothesis testing. Since we're assuming you just completed the course Basic Statistics, our treatment is a little more abstract and we go really fast! We provide the relevant Basic Statistics videos in case you need a gentler introduction. After the refresher we discuss methods to compare two groups on a categorical or quantitative dependent variable. We use different test for independent and dependent groups."
1623,Exam time!,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics?specialization=social-science,In this module we tackle categorical association. We'll mainly discuss the Chi-squared test that allows us to decide whether two categorical variables are related in the population. If two categorical variables are unrelated you would expect that categories of these variables don't 'go together'. You would expect the number of cases in each category of one variable to be proportionally similar at each level of the other variable. The Chi-squared test helps us to compare the actual number of cases for each combination of categories (the joint frequencies) to the expected number of cases if the variables are unrelated.
1624,Welcome to From ​Data ​to ​Insights ​with ​Google ​Cloud Platform: ​Exploring ​and ​Preparing ​your ​Data,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-exploring-preparing-data-bigquery,"In this module we’ll see how to describe the association between two quantitative variables using simple (linear) regression analysis. Regression analysis allows us to model the relation between two quantitative variables and - based on our sample -decide whether a 'real' relation exists in the population. Regression analysis is more useful than just calculating a correlation coefficient, since it allows us assess how well our regression line fits the data, it helps us to identify outliers and to predict scores on the dependent variable for new cases."
1625,Module 1: Introduction ​to ​Data ​on Google ​Cloud ​Platform,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-exploring-preparing-data-bigquery,"In this module we’ll see how we can use more than one predictor to describe or predict a quantitative outcome variable. In the social sciences relations between psychological and social variables are generally not very strong, since outcomes are generally influences by complex processes involving many variables. So it really helps to be able to describe an outcome variable with several predictors, not just to increase the fit of the model, but also to assess the individual contribution of each predictor, while controlling for the others. "
1626,Module 2: ​Big ​Data ​Tools ​Overview,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-exploring-preparing-data-bigquery,"In this module we'll discuss analysis of variance, a very popular technique that allows us to compare more than two groups on a quantitative dependent variable. The reason we call it analysis of variance is because we compare two estimates of the variance in the population. If the group means differ in the population then these variance estimates differ. Just like in multiple regression, factorial analysis of variance allows us to investigate the influence of several independent variables."
1627,Module 3: ​Exploring ​your ​Data ​with SQL,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-exploring-preparing-data-bigquery,"In this module we'll discuss the last topic of this course: Non-parametric tests. Until now we've mostly considered tests that require assumptions about the shape of the distribution (z-tests, t-tests and F-tests). Sometimes those assumptions don't hold. Non-parametric tests require fewer of those assumptions. There are several non-parametric tests that correspond to the parametric z-, t- and F-tests. These tests also come in handy when the response variable is an ordered categorical variable as opposed to a quantitative variable. There are also non-parametric equivalents to the correlation coefficient and some tests that have no parametric-counterparts."
1628,Module 4: ​Google ​BigQuery ​Pricing,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-exploring-preparing-data-bigquery,"In this final module there's no new material to study. We advise you to take some extra time to review the material from the previous modules and to practice for the final exam. We've provided a practice exam that you can take as many times as you like. The final exam is structured exactly like the practice exam, so you know what to expect. Please note that you can only take the final exam twice every seven days, so make sure you are fully prepared. Please follow the honor code and do not communicate or confer with others while taking this exam or after. In the open questions of the exam (i.e. those that are not multiple choice) you should report your answers to 3 decimal places, and use 5 decimal places in your calculations. Good luck!"

1656,Introduction to the Course,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"We hope you’re excited about the project that we're starting to build -- we sure are!  In this second part of this week, we'll walk you through setting up your system and working through your first assignment so you'll be having fun with it in no time. Before that though, we'll finish going over some of the fundamentals fundamentals of object oriented programming.  Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. Like the end of last week, the first part of this week might be a bit of a review of material you already learned in your first Java programming course.  If that’s the case, you are always welcome to skip to the first graded assignment on Objects, Memory Models, and Scope."
1657,Working with Strings,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Now that you have the tools to write and trace object oriented code, let’s get back to developing the project! In this first (real) part of the project, you will create an interactive graphical map that will display geospatial data. This is a highly interactive week, so make sure you’ve got Eclipse loaded up!  We encourage you to play around as you watch the videos.  Some of the code that we use in the videos is in the demos package in the starter code you set up for this course.  Open it up and experiment with it while you're watching the videos.  We also encourage you to dive right into the programming project, even before watching the videos, if you want.  The programming assignment instructions are in the last lesson of this week - you can watch a video walkthrough of the instructions and also read the step-by-step directions in the accompanying reading. There’s lots of room for creativity, too, so have fun!"
1658,Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Now that you’re in full swing with the project, let’s take a closer look at some concepts that you have already been using in your code.  Specifically, the keyword “extends”.  What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism.  These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future!  We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently.  If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this week.  As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.    "
1659,"Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and Correctness",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"You’ve reached an exciting point in the project - in this week you’ll add interactivity to your map!  You’ll be learning how to design event-driven programs, using a new and powerful programming paradigm.  Your map will now respond to mouse hovers and clicks. As always, make sure you're writing code along with us as you watch the videos and work through the week.  Also, feel free to dive into the programming assignment (project) whenever you are ready"
1660,Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries),6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"You've come a long way in this course, and you've got a great project to show for it. In this last module we'll shift gears a bit to talk about some very exciting and fundamental algorithms for finding and sorting data in an array.  Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here.  We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us.   We'll also apply sorting to your project, and you'll wrap things up by finishing your project with an extension of your own choosing."
1661,Hash Maps and Edit Distance,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"UC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

1662,Introduction to the Course,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we're going to dive into the course programming project.  In the first lesson you'll learn about Strings and Regular Expressions, and in the programming assignment this week you'll apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the ""readability"" of text by calculating something called the ""Flesch Readability Score"".  This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly.  So, let's get started building some code!"
1663,Introduction to Graphs,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Welcome to week 3!  The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice. "
1664,Class design and simple graph search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer."
1665,Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Welcome to week 4!  We know you've been working hard.  We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries.  You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!  You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now.  :)"
1666,Route planning and NP-hard graph problems,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"You made it to the last week!  Congratulations on getting this far!  In this last week we'll be looking at a fundamental data structure called a Hash Table.  If you thought trees were fast, just wait until you see what Hash Tables can do!   Your last programming assignment will add spelling correction suggestions to your text editor, and there's an optional assignment that builds on the same ideas as the main assignment too, if you have the time and energy.

1668,Welcome & What is a Software Engineering Interview?,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we'll start getting technical, introducing you to the central data structure in the course: Graphs.  You'll learn the basics and then have a chance to dive in a little deeper into the code, getting ready to start building that Google Maps-like application."
1669,Welcome & What is a Software Engineering Interview?: Lesson Choices,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week you'll get the backbone of your map search engine up and running.  In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments.  But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer.  This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine.  We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph.  Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search.  Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes.   Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine!"
1670,Live coding: the technical phone interview and beyond,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"In the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map.  In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a ""weighted graph"".  Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs.  To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.  In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another."
1671,Explaining what you've already done,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"In this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning.  For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve ""hard"" problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms.  We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!  "
1672,Explaining what you've already done: Lesson Choices,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview?specialization=java-object-oriented,"You made it to the last week of our course!  We're glad you're still with us.  As a reward, there's no new content to learn this week.  Instead you'll get the opportunity to extend your project in a direction of your own choosing.  We hope you've got some neat ideas for personalizing your map application, and we look forward to seeing them in the peer review gallery.  Submitting to the peer review gallery is optional (though the extension is required), but we hope you'll choose to participate.  "

1675,How to Find an Example?,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-a-proof?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"Now that you’ve gotten warmed up, it’s time to practice your coding skills.  One of the things you’ll almost certainly be asked to do during a technical phone interview is to code up a solution to a problem in a shared text document (e.g. Google doc) while you are on the phone with the interviewer.  This experience can be intimidating, unfamiliar and humbling if you are not prepared, so this week we will give you lots of practice and tips for getting through this part of the interview with flying colors.  "
1676,Recursion and Induction,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-a-proof?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"This week, we’re going to focus on how to speak about your experiences working on projects and how to speak about the technical problems you’ve experienced and how you’ve solved those problems.  We’ll introduce the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Results) model for presenting your work, and discuss how to and how not to present the problem you worked on and the solution you developed.  We’ll also discuss the communication skills that are critical to this task.  It’s a fun week with lots of examples (both good and bad), which ends with an assignment where you will present your own work on video and submit this video for peer review."

1678,Invariants,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-a-proof?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"As we saw in week 2, coding on the fly can be a difficult task!  In this final week of the course we’ll revisit the skill of live problem solving by looking at how to solve more challenging algorithmic problems (and write the code associated with the solution) on the whiteboard.  You’ll recognize these problems as “classic” interview problems you’ve probably heard a lot about, designed to test your problem solving skills as well as your analysis and coding abilities.  Don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to approach them with confidence through a 6-step process to addressing technical questions (hint: you don’t have to produce the perfect solution on the first try!).  We’ll show you how to use this process in a number of examples.  But of course, there is no substitute for practice, so we’ll set you up with how to train and evaluate yourself."
1679,Solving a 15-Puzzle,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-a-proof?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"UC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

1680,Basic Counting,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/combinatorics?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"We'll discover two powerful methods of defining objects, proving concepts, and implementing programs — recursion and induction. These two methods are heavily used, in particular, in algorithms — for analysing correctness and running time of algorithms as well as for implementing efficient solutions. You will see that induction is as simple as falling dominos, but allows to make convincing arguments for arbitrarily large and complex problems by decomposing them and moving step by step. You will learn how famous Gauss unexpectedly solved his teacher's problem intended to keep him busy the whole lesson in just two minutes, and in the end you will be able to prove his formula using induction. You will be able to generalize scary arithmetic exercises and then solve them easily using induction."
1681,Binomial Coefficients,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/combinatorics?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"We have already invoked mathematical logic when we discussed how to make convincing arguments by giving examples. This week we will turn mathematical logic full on. We will discuss its basic operations and rules. We will see how logic can play a crucial and indispensable role in creating convincing arguments. We will discuss how to construct a negation to the statement, and you will see  how to win an argument by showing your opponent is wrong with just one example called counterexample!. We will see tricky and seemingly counterintuitive, but yet (an unintentional pun) logical aspects of mathematical logic. We will see one of the oldest approaches to making convincing arguments: Reductio ad Absurdum."
1682,Advanced Counting,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/combinatorics?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"""There are things that never change"". Apart from being just a philosophical statement, this phrase turns out to be an important idea that can actually help. In this module we will see how it can help in problem solving. Things that do not change are called invariants in mathematics. They form an important tool of proving with numerous applications, including estimating running time of programs and algorithms. We will get some intuition of what they are, see how they can look like, and get some practice in using them."
1683,Probability,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/combinatorics?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"In this module, we consider a well known 15-puzzle where one needs to restore order among 15 square pieces in a square box. It turns out that the behavior of this puzzle is determined by mathematics: it is solvable if and only if the corresponding permutation is even. We will learn the basic properties of even and odd permutations. The task is to write a program that determines whether a permutation is even or odd. There is also a more difficult bonus task: to write a program that actually computes a solution (sequence of moves) for a given position assuming that this position is solvable."

However, successful application of this knowledge on practice requires considerable experience in this kind of problems. In this module we will address the final standard setting in our course, combinations with repetitions, and then we will gain some experience by discussing various problems in Combinatorics."
1687,CYCLES,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/graphs?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"The word ""probability"" is used quite often in the everyday life. However, not always we can speak about probability as some number: for that a mathematical model is needed. What is this mathematical model (probability space)? How to compute probabilities (if the model is given)? How to judge whether the model is adequate? What is conditional probability and Bayes' theorem? How our plausible reasoning can be interpreted in terms of Bayes' theorem? In this module we cover these questions using some simple examples of probability spaces and real life sutiations."
1688,Graph Classes,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/graphs?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"In the previous module we discussed how to compute probabilities of random events. But in many practical situation we are interested not only in positive or negative outcome, but also in some quantitative characteristics of an outcome. Among these cases are number of  steps of an algorithms, number of points that one can win in the games involving any kind of randomness, all quantitative characteristics of a random person in some group of people. Basically settings of this kind arise in all situations when (a) any kind of uncertainty is presented (b) we are interested in quantitative characteristics. The mathematical model for this is called random variables. And we will discuss them in this module."
1689,Graph Parameters,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/graphs?specialization=discrete-mathematics,"In this module, we will apply accumulated knowledge to create a project solving a certain dice game. The game is very simple: two players pick a dice each from a given pool of dices with various numbers on their sides. Then each player throws his dice and the one with the greater number on his dice wins. The game looks very simple and it seems that it is very easy to play this game optimally once we know our pool of dices. Yet it turns out that this intuition is overwhelmingly wrong: the game turns out to be very counterintuitive. In this module we will discuss the game in detail and create a program that finds an optimal strategy to play the game on a given pool of dices."

Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.

This module provides a review of least squares, for the cases of unweighted and weighted observations. There is a deep connection between least squares and maximum likelihood estimators (when the observations are considered to be Gaussian random variables) and this connection is established and explained.

1957,Module 1: Basics of 3D Computer Vision,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"Any engineer working on autonomous vehicles must understand the Kalman filter, first described in a paper by Rudolf Kalman in 1960. The filter has been recognized as one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century, is implemented in software that runs on your smartphone and on modern jet aircraft, and was crucial to enabling the Apollo spacecraft to reach the moon. This module derives the Kalman filter equations from a least squares perspective, for linear systems. The module also examines why the Kalman filter is the best linear unbiased estimator (that is, it is optimal in the linear case). The Kalman filter, as originally published, is a linear algorithm; however, all systems in practice are nonlinear to some degree. Shortly after the Kalman filter was developed, it was extended to nonlinear systems, resulting in an algorithm now called the ‘extended’ Kalman filter, or EKF. The EKF is the ‘bread and butter’ of state estimators, and should be in every engineer’s toolbox. This module explains how the EKF operates (i.e., through linearization) and discusses its relationship to the original Kalman filter. The module also provides an overview of the unscented Kalman filter, a more recently developed and very popular member of the Kalman filter family."

In this module we will get into the nuts and bolts of deficits and debts in the real world and I am sure we will have some interesting follow-up discussions!  How is it really used? What are government deficits and debts? When governments run deficits and need to borrow money, how and where do they do it? When are these deficits and debts more of a problem? This module will look at the US and other leading economies in recent years to answer these questions, clear up some common misconceptions, and point to what the most important concerns are with deficits and debts at the present time.

2035, Trade,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/trade-immigration-exchange-rates-globalized-world,"Welcome to Module 4!This week we're tackling a fascinating issue, which is monetary policy, and I anticipate some very interesting debates. Monetary policy is the other main tool that governments can use to influence the economy. Monetary authorities work through the money supply and can use open market operations, their own lending rates and reserve or cash ratios to influence money markets and hence the real economy. Just as with fiscal policy, once the gap in the economy is identified, expansive monetary policy should be used in a recessionary gap and restrictive monetary policy in an inflationary gap. Monetary policy is superior to fiscal policy in many ways, but its greatest weakness is that it does not work nearly as well in recessionary gaps as in inflationary gaps.
 
Keep up the good work!"

We have so many tools in hand now that we can spend our last sessions putting the pieces together and tackling real-world policy questions. There is little that could be more relevant, and I hope you will enjoy it. In the real world, fiscal and monetary authorities may move in the same policy directions or they may act in opposition to one another. We will explore what happens as fiscal and monetary policies interact in the real economy. Additionally, economic decision-makers have two other policies that they can use to influence the economy, which are exchange-rate policy and structural policy. We will discuss how these work, and what special complications and advantages they present. There is also a peer-evaluated assignment for this course, and it’s included in this module. You will use the Economic Policy Simulator, a free interactive exercise, to make policy for an unknown country.

We will discuss whether interest rates have been appropriate in a group of countries, and what the consequences are if they are not. We will also discuss quantitative easing, the main “unconventional” monetary policy, and anticipate some of its consequences. We will have a look at deficits and debt in some countries and use the tools to determine whether they are problematic; we will analyze the “austerity” policies applied in many European countries; and we will have a look at the combination of fiscal, monetary and structural policies being used in Japan, dubbed “Abenomics”. We´ll also consider the perils of policymakers´ aggressive pursuit of growth at a time when it is becoming more elusive. The final exam will have questions from this module and from each of the previous modules, so you can study your earlier quizzes to prepare. Good luck as you complete the course!

In this module we explore some of the details involved in the design and implementation of IoT devices. Unlike traditional computer-based systems, IoT devices are “embedded” within other devices in order to provide enhanced functionality without exposing the user to the complexities of a computer. The users interact with the device in a natural way, similar to their interactions with any other objects in the world. In this way, an embedded system has an interface that conforms to the expectations and needs of the users. Establishing a natural interface requires that the embedded system interface with the physical world directly through sensors, which read the state of the world, and actuators, which change the state of the world. In this module we will discuss the structure of embedded systems and describe these interactions with the physical world."

When we ""zoom out"" to the genome level, we find that substitutions, insertions, and deletions don't tell the whole story of evolution: we need to model more dramatic evolutionary events known as <strong>genome rearrangements</strong>, which wrench apart chromosomes and put them back together in a new order. A natural question to ask is whether there are ""fragile regions"" hidden in your genome where chromosome breakage has occurred more often over millions of years. This week, we will begin addressing this question by asking how we can compute the number of rearrangements on the evolutionary path connecting two species.</p>

2573,Leader as Influencer and Collaborator,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/emotional-intelligence-in-leadership,"This module will cover Project Planning which is the second phase of Project Life Cycle. We first look at what Project Scope is and what scope creep refers to. Work Breakdown structure leading to work packages or activities with the associated precedence relationships are treated in detail.  The next topic is about scheduling of the activities which requires the estimation of activity durations. The estimation of duration, cost and resource required for the identified activities are covered later as a separate topic. Here, using the same software development project, assuming that the durations of the activities have been estimated and ignoring the resource requirements for the different activities, we show how a schedule for the activities can be arrived at. The next topic is the estimation of durations, cost and resources required for the activities. Three popular estimating procedures are covered. The next topic covers the various reasons, possible benefits and different alternatives for reducing project duration. We then discuss in detail, one approach to reducing project duration viz. by incurring additional incremental direct cost for reducing activity durations and show how we can arrive at the least incremental direct cost for any specified project completion time. While the approach presented is conceptually sound it is difficult to implement for large projects. So, the next topic covers a linear programming approach to solve the same problem even if the project under consideration is large in terms of the number of activities.   As in the previous module, towards the end of this module also, we present some practical aspects pertaining to the concepts covered. This again is done through a Q & A format with Mr. Prashun Dutta, Advisor - Gaiga Smart Cities"
2574,Leader as Change Agent,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/emotional-intelligence-in-leadership,"Activities in a project typically require the use of resources such as people, material, equipment and working capital. The schedule for the activities that we had calculated in the previous module assumes that adequate resources are available as and when required. However, in practice often adequate resources may not be available as required and the schedule may have to be modified. There are two types of problems when resource requirements are considered. One is the Resource Smoothing Problem and the other is the Resource Limitation problem. In the first one, i.e. the Resource Smoothing Problem, although the resources are available as and when required, we would want to find a schedule that “smoothes” the use of resources without delaying the project completion time.  Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is the next topic dealt with in this module.  CCPM has not gained universal acceptance although it is being used by some organizations with positive results. CCPM places a lot of emphasis on aggressive estimation of activity durations and provides for buffers to take care of some delays.  With Risk Management, we first define what risk is and then discuss the risk management process including risk identification, risk assessment and various ways of reducing exposure to risk. Risk monitoring and control including change control process are also covered. Finally, the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) including a simulation approach to finding the distribution of the project completion time is covered as the last topic in this module. As in the previous modules, towards the end of this module, we present some practical aspects pertaining to the concepts covered. This again is done through a Q & A format with Mr. Prashun Dutta, Advisor - Gaiga Smart Cities"

The manifesto and agenda for agile project management are also covered.The next topic in this module is Monitoring and Control. The projects in progress should be reviewed at pre-specified intervals. The process of monitoring and control including the analysis of the status of the project are covered. The last two topics to be covered are Audit and Closure of projects. The audit may be of an ongoing project or of a completed project. The various steps involved in the audit process including the staffing of the audit team, functioning of the team, data collection, analysis and reports are covered in detail.The closure of a project may be a normal closure or a premature closure. The various tasks involved including the delivery of the output of the project, evaluation of the team as well as the project manager are spelt out.

2577,Financial Valuation of New IT Investments at ICPL,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-tech-project,"People are at the center of any organization. For leaders to achieve organizational goals, theyneed to understand the people they are leading. To be effective, a leader has to allocate

significant time and effort to build and develop cooperative relationships with key internal and

external stakeholders. Building and maintaining relationships is a critical competence for

effective leaders. This is aimed at not just direct reports. You also need positive relations with

peers, bosses, senior leaders, people at operating levels and relevant others outside the

organization. When there is mutual trust, influence and credibility, organizational work

becomes easier. In short, relationships are critical for leadership success.

This module will focus on the topics of listening, coaching and feedback, delegation and

building effective teams. We also have an interview with an industry expert on building

resonant relationships."
2578,Integrated IT Project Management Plan,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-tech-project,"Organizations are teams of teams. By definition, a manager gets work done not only throughone’s own resources and efforts, but also through others. In other words, you are required to

work effectively with people outside your team. These are individuals and groups within the

organization and also outside. You have to influence people at different levels and functions,

build collaborative relationships wherever possible, negotiate wisely, handle difficult

conversations and make decisions in the face of uncertainty and complexity. In this complex

arena, formal authority or position power is only a limited resource. You have to influence

without authority, and this will require you to draw on your personal power, resources and

approaches. You have to develop skills and mindsets for the challenges of managing conflict,

handling difficult conversations and carrying out effective negotiations.

This module will deal with the topics of influence, conflict management, handling difficult

conversations, negotiation and decision making. As a part of this module, we have two

interviews – one with a negotiation expert on what it takes to be an effective negotiator, and

the second with an industry expert on the topic of complex decision making."
2579,Change Management & Communications Plan,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-tech-project,"Research and practice show that managers and organisations face huge difficulties in reaching set targets through their change management initiatives. As a frontline leader, you are expected to bring about changes without having the authority to issue orders or give directives.You won’t have all the authority and resources, and yet you would be expected to bring about effective changes in your sphere of functioning. Changes are required to respond to newer opportunities and threats faster than your competitors. You would be expected to be both change agents and bring about effective changes; and at the same time, change recipients and operate within the framework of a larger mandate or organisational direction given to you from higher levels.

2692,多态与虚函数,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,"Peking University is determined to make its education openly accessible to students in China and around the world. With over 3000 faculty members, Peking University offers excellence in teaching and learning.Founded in 1898, Peking University (PKU) was the first national comprehensive university in China. For the past 115 years, with its hundreds of thousands of outstanding alumni, Peking University has made prominent contributions in the humanities and sciences to further China's prosperity and progress."
2693,文件操作和模板,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,C++是在C语言的基础上创建的一门功能更为强大的面向对象程序设计语言。在正式开始C++程序设计学习之初，我们首先回顾C语言中的高级内容，包括函数指针、命令行参数、位运算和动态内存分配，并在此基础上对C语言进行扩充，引入了引用、const关键字和常量、内联函数和重载函数、函数缺省参数等内容，为后续的C++程序设计的学习打下基础。面向对象的程序设计更接近于真实世界，它要分析待解决的问题中，有哪些类事物，每类事物都有哪些特点，不同的事物种类之间是什么关系，事物之间如何相互作用。本模块将初步介绍面向对象的程序设计的基本内容，尤其是“类”和“对象”这两个重要概念。PS：我们这门课程一直处在不断地建设与优化当中，吸取了很多以往课程的经典视频，所以如果你看到视频中出现了不同课程的名字，也不要惊讶哦，因为你正在集百家所长：）
2694,标准模板库 STL-1,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,在对类和对象有了初步的了解后，大家已经知道类是C++中十分重要的概念，它是实现面向对象程序设计的基础。类是所有面向对象的语言的共同特征，所有面向对象的语言都提供了这种类型。本模块将进一步介绍类和对象的相关深入概念与内容，包括用于初始化的构造函数，以及复制构造函数，析构函数等。
2695,标准模板库 STL-2,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,如果不做特殊处理的话，C++的“+”“-”“*”“/”等运算符只能用于对基本类型的常量或变量进行运算，不能用于对象之间的运算。我们希望对象之间也能用这些运算符进行运算，例如，复数之间是可以进行四则运算的，两个复数对象相加如果直接用“+”运算符完成，那不是很直观和简洁吗？本模块将介绍利用C++提供的“运算符重载”机制，赋予运算符新的功能，就能解决对象之间运算的问题。
2696,期末考试,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,代码重用是提高软件开发效率的重要手段，因此C++对代码重用有很强的支持，继承与派生就是支持代码重用的机制之一。例如，要编写一个学生管理程序，必然要设计一个“学生”类，“学生”类会包含学生共有的姓名、学号等属性，但是中学生、大学生、研究生又有各自不同的属性和方法，如果为每种学生单独编写一个类会造成重复与浪费。本模块将介绍通过继承和派生机制，可以在基类的基础上派生出不同的类，从而达到代码重用的目的。
2697,[选学] C++高级主题和C++11新特性,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,多态是指同一名字的事物可以完成不同的功能，例如有几个相似而不完全相同的对象，有时人们要求在向它们发出同一个消息时，它们的反应各不相同，分别执行不同的操作。在C++中，所谓多态性是指由继承而产生的相关的不同的类，其对象对同一消息会作出不同的响应。多态性是面向对象程序设计的一个重要特征，能有效增加程序的灵活性。
2698,结束语,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,计算机中为了便于数据的管理和检索，引入了“文件”的概念。在程序中，要使用一个文件，先要打开，打开后才能读写，读写完后要关闭。本模块将介绍C++流类相应的成员函数来实现文件操作的功能。此外，你还将学习到如何通过编写模板进行泛型程序设计，所谓“泛型”就是算法只要实现一遍，就能适用于多种数据类型。也可以说，泛型程序设计就是大量编写模板、使用模板的程序设计。
2699,欢迎加入我们！,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,本模块将介绍C++的标准模板库（Standard Template Library，STL），这是泛型程序设计最成功的应用实例。STL是一些常用数据结构（如链表、可变长数组、排序二叉树）和算法（如排序、查找）的模板的集合。有了STL，你就不必编写大多的、常用的数据结构和算法。即便不想用面向对象的程序设计方法编程，学习STL也是大有裨益的。
2700,枚举,12,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-chengxu-sheji?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,本模块将继续介绍C++的标准模板库（Standard Template Library，STL），这是泛型程序设计最成功的应用实例。STL是一些常用数据结构（如链表、可变长数组、排序二叉树）和算法（如排序、查找）的模板的集合。有了STL，你就不必编写大多的、常用的数据结构和算法。即便不想用面向对象的程序设计方法编程，学习STL也是大有裨益的。
2701,递归,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,基础Wow~ 恭喜你已顺利完成了C++课程八个模块知识点的学习，在被魔兽世界各种虐心虐神之后，有没有对于C++有着一点高屋建瓴的别样体会啊？快来最后体验一下我们的期末测试吧（这是原汁原味的北京大学该课程试题，没有任何改动）！也希望与大家相聚在专项课程的下一门《算法设计》课程中，有了C和C++两种程序语言的基础，你需要进一步提升自身的算法设计技巧，让程序跑的通，还要跑的妙！
2702,动态规划（1）,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,[选学] C++高级主题和C++11新特性: 本模块给大家介绍一些C++程序设计的进阶内容，以及最新C++11标准的部分新特性。该模块内容不属于本课程必须掌握的教学内容，但是通过了解和学习必将为你打开一扇C++学习的新门，继续探索程序设计的各种精妙与美好！
2703,动态规划（2）,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,每一次的结束与分离，都是为了我们下一次更好的相遇。期待与你相会在《算法基础》课程！这次的视频我们来点儿不一样的吧 ^_____^
2704,深度优先搜索（1）,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,"Peking University is determined to make its education openly accessible to students in China and around the world. With over 3000 faculty members, Peking University offers excellence in teaching and learning.Founded in 1898, Peking University (PKU) was the first national comprehensive university in China. For the past 115 years, with its hundreds of thousands of outstanding alumni, Peking University has made prominent contributions in the humanities and sciences to further China's prosperity and progress."
2705,深度优先搜索（2）,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,在日常生活中我们经常遇到这样的情景：数字密码最后一位忘记了，就从0~9逐个尝试；去提货点取快递，快递员检查完所有包裹才找到属于你的；警察列举出所有的嫌疑人才有可能发现真凶…以上在进行归纳推理时，逐个考察了某类事情的所有可能情况，并逐一进行检验，这种方法叫做枚举。枚举比较直观，易于理解，本模块将介绍枚举算法的基本数学模型和常用策略，从而解决通过公式推导、规则演绎的方法不能解决的问题。PS：我们这门课程一直处在不断地建设与优化当中，吸取了很多以往课程的经典视频，所以如果你看到视频中出现了不同课程的名字，也不要惊讶哦，因为你正在集百家所长：）
2706,广度优先搜索,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,递归调用是设计和描述算法的一种有力工具，尤其是在解决复杂问题时经常采用。它的基本思想是要解决某一问题A，可以先解决一个形式相同，但规模小一点的问题B。问题B如果解决了，那么问题A也就迎刃而解。有些问题使用传统的迭代算法是很难求解甚至无解的，而使用递归却可以很容易地解决。本模块将通过具体的例题介绍如何构造递归函数，如何设置递归终止的条件以及分析递归算法的复杂度。
2707,二分与贪心,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,通过上一模块的学习，你已经了解如何通过递归的办法解决问题，但是单纯的递归往往会导致子问题被重复计算，因此在解决某些问题的时候，效率会很低。而将一个问题分解为子问题递归求解，并且将中间结果保存以避免重复计算的方法就叫做“动态规划”。本模块将初步介绍对于特定的问题如何寻找子问题、定义问题的状态以及状态转移方程。
2708,期末考试,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,如何进行动态规划，没有一定之规，需要具体问题具体分析。本模块首先由典型的“最长上升子序列”引入，进一步展示几个较难的动规例题，深入探讨动态规划算法中状态的设计以及状态转移关系的构建。
2709,结束语,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,想象我们在一座迷宫里，如何才能找到出口呢？最直观的方法是从入口开始沿着一条路一直走到底，如果遇到分叉路口就选择其中一条道路走下去，如果遇到死胡同就退回到上一个分叉路口，选择另一条道路走下去，如果遇到出口就成功走出迷宫了。这种尽量往深处走的做法即是深度优先搜索(深搜）。深搜算法编程简单，简洁易懂，空间需求也比较低，但是这种方法的时间复杂度往往是指数级的，如果不加以优化，时间效率无法忍受。本模块将通过实例继续讨论深度优先搜索算法中优化程序的基本方法“剪枝”，即在设计剪枝判断方法的基础上，避免一些不必要的遍历过程，从而提高算法效率。
2710,The future of manufacturing and innovation,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,本模块继续通过两道例题，强调了两种最通用的剪枝方法：可行性剪枝和最优性剪枝的应用。可行性剪枝即在寻找解的过程中，预判出从当前状态出发不可能找到解，从而不再从当前状态继续；最优性剪枝就是记录到目前为止找到的最优解，当发现正在探索的解其代价已经不小于最优解，或预测出其最终代价必将不小于最优解，则停止当前解的探索。
2711,Design Innovation Practices,11,https://www.coursera.org/learn/suanfa-jichu?specialization=biancheng-suanfa,"与深度优先搜索算法类似，广度优先搜索(广搜)也是常用的搜索图的算法。它的思想是从一个顶点开始，辐射状地优先遍历其周围较广的区域。一般可以用它做什么呢？一个最直观经典的例子就是走迷宫，从起点开始，找出到终点的最短路程，很多最短路径算法都是基于广搜的思想。广索的基本方法是使用队列存放已经扩展过的节点。本模块先以简单例题引入广搜的基本实现方法，然后再通过经典的""八数码""问题，进一步介绍状态表示、判重的节省时间和空间的技巧。"
2712,Foundational Concepts,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-digital-manufacturing-fusion-360?specialization=cad-design-digital-manufacturing,二分法是在有序或单调的区间中快速寻找答案的有效方法，当数据量很大适宜采用该方法。所谓贪心算法，即总是作出在当前看来最好的选择。也就是说贪心算法并不从整体最优考虑，它所作出的选择只是在某种意义上的局部最优选择。但是，贪心算法对很多问题都能得到整体最优解。在一些情况下，即使贪心算法不能得到整体最优解，其最终结果却是最优解的很好近似。贪心算法没有固定的算法框架，算法设计的关键是贪心策略的选择。本模块将介绍二分与贪心这两个对很多问题都非常有效的算法策略。

2799,"Continue Your Journey with the Specialization ""Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java""",7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn the fundamentals of task parallelism. Tasks are the most basic unit of parallel programming. An increasing number of programming languages (including Java and C++) are moving from older thread-based approaches to more modern task-based approaches for parallel programming. We will learn about task creation, task termination, and the “computation graph” theoretical model for understanding various properties of task-parallel programs.  These properties include work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, and Amdahl’s Law. We will also learn popular Java APIs for task parallelism, most notably the Fork/Join framework."
2800,Welcome to the Course!,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java,"Welcome to Module 2!  In this module, we will learn about approaches to parallelism that have been inspired by functional programming.  Advocates of parallel functional programming have argued for decades that functional parallelism can eliminate many hard-to-detect bugs that can occur with imperative parallelism.  We will learn about futures, memoization, and streams, as well as data races, a notorious class of bugs that can be avoided with functional parallelism.  We will also learn Java APIs for functional parallelism, including the Fork/Join framework and the Stream API’s."

2802,Critical Sections and Isolation,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"Welcome to Module 3, and congratulations on reaching the midpoint of this course!  It is well known that many applications spend a majority of their execution time in loops, so there is a strong motivation to learn how loops can be sped up through the use of parallelism, which is the focus of this module.  We will start by learning how parallel counted-for loops can be conveniently expressed using forall and stream APIs in Java, and how these APIs can be used to parallelize a simple matrix multiplication program.  We will also learn about the barrier construct for parallel loops, and illustrate its use with a simple iterative averaging program example.  Finally, we will learn the importance of grouping/chunking parallel iterations to reduce overhead."
2803,Talking to Two Sigma: Using it in the Field,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"Welcome to the last module of the course!  In this module, we will wrap up our introduction to parallel programming by learning how data flow principles can be used to increase the amount of parallelism in a program.  We will learn how Java’s Phaser API can be used to implement “fuzzy” barriers, and also “point-to-point” synchronizations as an optimization of regular barriers by revisiting the iterative averaging example.  Finally, we will also learn how pipeline parallelism and data flow models can be expressed using Java APIs.  "
2804,Actors,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Concurrent Programming and Distributed Programming in Java. Professor Vivek Sarkar will speak with industry professionals at Two Sigma about how the topics of our other two courses are utilized in the field.
2805,Concurrent Data Structures,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"Rice University is consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the U.S. and the top 100 in the world. Rice has highly respected schools of Architecture, Business, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Music, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences and is home to the Baker Institute for Public Policy."
2806,"Continue Your Journey with the Specialization ""Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java""",7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn about threads and locks, which have served as primitive building blocks for concurrent programming for over five decades.  All computing platforms today include some form of support for threads and locks, and make them available for use by developers in a wide range of programming languages. We will learn how threads can be created, joined, and synchronized using structured (e.g., synchronized statements/methods) and unstructured (e.g., java.util.concurrent libraries) locks in Java.  We will also learn about new classes of bugs that can arise when concurrent programs need to access shared resources.  These bugs are referred to as violations of liveness/progress guarantees, and include deadlock, livelock, and starvation.  We will conclude this module by studying different solutions to the classical ""Dining Philosophers"" problem, and use these solutions to illustrate instances of deadlock, livelock and starvation."
2807,Welcome to the Course!,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn different approaches to coordinating accesses to shared resources without encountering the deadlock or livelock bugs studied earlier.  Critical/isolated sections are higher-level concurrent programming constructs (relative to locks) that simplify the implementation of mutual exclusion by guaranteeing the absence of deadlocks and livelocks.  Object-based isolation relaxes the constraints imposed by critical sections by allowing mutual exclusion to be specified on a per-object basis, as illustrated in the Spanning Tree example.  Java's atomic variables represent an important, but restricted, case of object-based isolation that is implemented efficiently on all hardware platforms.  Finally, we will learn how object-based isolation can be further relaxed with read/write access modes."
2808,DISTRIBUTED MAP REDUCE,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"Join Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Software Engineer, Dr. Shams Imam, at their downtown Houston, Texas office about threads, locks, deadlocks, high-level and low-level constructs, and the importance of concurrent programming."
2809,CLIENT-SERVER PROGRAMMING,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn another high-level approach to concurrent programming called the ""Actor"" model.  A major difference between the Actor model and the Isolated Sections model is that there are no data races possible in the Actor model because it does not allow for any form of shared variables.  However, as in all concurrent programming models, higher-level forms of nondeterminism are still possible in the Actor model due to an inherent asynchrony in the order in which messages may be delivered.  We will study multiple examples of concurrency using the Actor model, including the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers, as well as producer-consumer patterns with both unbounded and bounded buffers."
2810,Talking to Two Sigma: Using it in the Field,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will study Concurrent Data Structures, which form an essential software layer in all multithreaded programming systems.  First, we will learn about Optimistic Concurrency, an important multithreaded pattern in which two threads can ""optimistically"" make progress on their assigned work without worrying about mutual conflicts, and only checking for conflicts before ""committing"" the results of their work.  We will then study the widely-used Concurrent Queue data structure.  Even though the APIs for using concurrent queues are very simple, their implementations using the Optimistic Concurrency model can be complex and error-prone.   To that end, we will also learn the formal notion of Linearizability to better understand correctness requirements for concurrent data structures.  We will then study Concurrent Hash Maps, another widely-used concurrent data structure.  Finally, we discuss a concurrent algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree of an undirected graph, an algorithm that relies on the use of Concurrent Data Structures under the covers."
2811,MESSAGE PASSING,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Parallel Programming and Distributed Programming in Java.

2813,"Continue Your Journey with the Specialization ""Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java""",7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn about the MapReduce paradigm, and how it can be used to write distributed programs that analyze data represented as key-value pairs.  A MapReduce program is defined via user-specified map and reduce functions, and we will learn how to write such programs in the Apache Hadoop and Spark projects.  TheMapReduce paradigm can be used to express a wide range of parallel algorithms.  One example that we will study is computation of the TermFrequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) statistic used in document mining; this algorithm uses a fixed (non-iterative) number of map and reduce operations.  Another MapReduce example that we will study is parallelization of the PageRank algorithm.  This algorithm is an example of iterative MapReduce computations, and is also the focus of the mini-project associated with this module."
2814,Introduction to FinTech,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn about client-server programming, and how distributed Java applications can communicate with each other using sockets.  Since communication via sockets occurs at the level of bytes, we will learn how to serialize objects into bytes in the sender process and to deserialize bytes into objects in the receiver process. Sockets and serialization provide the necessary background for theFile Server mini-project associated with this module.  We will also learn about Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which extends the notion of method invocation in a sequential program to a distributed programming setting.  Likewise, we will learn about multicast sockets,which generalize the standard socket interface to enable a sender to send the same message to a specified set of receivers; this capability can be very useful for a number of applications, including news feeds,video conferencing, and multi-player games.  Finally, we will learn about distributed publish-subscribe applications, and how they can be implemented using the Apache Kafka framework."
2815,FinTech Business Applications,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"Join Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Two Sigma Managing Director, Jim Ward, and Senior Vice President, Dr. Eric Allen at their downtown Houston, Texas office about the importance of distributed programming."
2816,The Tech of FinTech,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fintech,"In this module, we will learn how to write distributed applications in the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model, specifically by using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.  MPI processes can send and receive messages using primitives for point-to-point communication, which are different in structure and semantics from message-passing with sockets.  We will also learn about the message ordering and deadlock properties of MPI programs.  Non-blocking communications are an interesting extension of point-to-point communications, since they can be used to avoid delays due to blocking and to also avoid deadlock-related errors.  Finally, we will study collective communication, which can involve multiple processes in a manner that is more powerful than multicast and publish-subscribe operations.  The knowledge of MPI gained in this module will be put to practice in the mini-project associated with this module on implementing a distributed matrix multiplication program in MPI."
2817,FinTech Implications for Established Business,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fintech,"In this module, we will study the roles of processes and threads as basic building blocks of parallel, concurrent, and distributed Java programs.  With this background, we will then learn how to implement multithreaded servers for increased responsiveness in distributed applications written using sockets, and apply this knowledge in the mini-project on implementing a parallel file server using both multithreading and sockets.  An analogous approach can also be used to combine MPI and multithreading, so as to improve the performance of distributed MPI applications.  Distributed actors serve as yet another example of combining distribution and multithreading.  A notable property of the actor model is that the same high-level constructs can be used to communicate among actors running in the same process and among actors in different processes; the difference between the two cases depends on the application configuration, rather the application code.  Finally, we will learn about the reactive programming model,and its suitability for implementing distributed service oriented architectures using asynchronous events."
2818,Introduction to FinTech Security & Regulation,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fintech,The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Parallel Programming and Concurrent Programming in Java.

2835,Learning Data,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-applied,"Predicting the future is easy, but being right in what you are predicting is hard.  One challenge in regard to understanding the impact of change in the future is that the pace of change is often more important than the eventual nature of market evolution.  If change is fast, large established firms are likely to be disrupted and face new competitors that will challenge prior industry structures.  When change is slower, or more evolutionary in nature, large firms have time to adapt and thrive in spite of change (although it still may be hard to change culture, even if the changes are slow).  In this module, we will examine both the evolution of FinTech markets and capabilities, and the likely pace of changes."

Several different methods exist for generating gene expression levels for all of the genes in the genome in tissues or even at cell-type-specific resolution. In this class we'll be processing and then examining some gene expression data generated using RNA-seq. We'll explore one of the main databases for RNA-seq expression data, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and then use an open-source suite of programs in R called BioConductor to process the raw reads from 4 RNA-seq data sets, to summarize their expression levels, to select significantly differentially expressed genes, and finally to visualize these as a heat map."

Several different methods exist for generating gene expression levels for all of the genes in the genome in tissues or even at cell-type-specific resolution. In this class we'll be hierarchically clustering our significantly differentially expressed genes from last time using BioConductor and the built-in function of an online tool, called Expression Browser.

Gene expression is controlled in part by the presence of short sequences in the promoters (and other parts) of genes, called cis-elements, which permit transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to bind to direct the patterns of expression in certain tissues or cells or in response to environmental stimuli: We'll explore a couple of sets of promoters of genes that are coexpressed with AP3 from Arabidopsis, and with INSULIN from human, for the presence of known cis-elements, and we'll also try to predict some new ones using a couple of different methods."

2960,Identifying genes related to your gene of interest,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-bioinformatics,"The regulation of gene expression is one of the main ways by which a plant can control the abundance of a gene product (post-translational modifications and protein degradation are some others). When and where a gene is expressed is controlled to a large extent by the presence of short sequence motifs, called cis-elements, present in the promoter of the gene. These in turn are regulated by transcription factors that perhaps get induced in response to environmental stresses or during specific developmental programs. Thus understanding which transcription factors can bind to which promoters can help us understand the role the downstream genes might be playing in a biological system."
2961,Analysis of the function of your gene of interest and its network of genes,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-bioinformatics-capstone,"Often the results of 'omics experiments are large lists of genes, such as those that are differentially expressed. We can use a ""cherry picking"" approach to explore individual genes in those lists but it's nice to be able to have an automated way of analyzing them. Here tools for performing Gene Ontology enrichment analysis are invaluable and can tell you if any particular biological processes or molecular functions are over-represented in your gene list. We'll explore AgriGO, AmiGO, tools at TAIR and the BAR, and g:Profiler, which all allow you to do such analyses. Another useful analysis is to be able to map your gene lists (along with associated e.g. expression values) onto pathway representations, and we'll use AraCyc and MapMan to do this. In this way it is easy to see if certain biosynthetic reactions are upregulated, which can help you interpret your 'omics data!"
2962,Lab report draft,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-bioinformatics-capstone,"Molecules inside the cell rarely operate in isolation. Proteins act together to form complexes, or are part of signal transduction cascades. Transcription factors bind to cis-elements in promoters or elsewhere and can act as activators or repressors of transcription. MicroRNAs can affect transcription in other ways. One of the main themes to have emerged in the past two decades in biology is that of networks. In terms of protein-protein interaction networks, often proteins that are highly connected with others are crucial for biological function – when these “hubs” are perturbed, we see large phenotypic effects. The way that transcription factors interact with downstream promoters, some driving the expression of other transcription factors that in turn regulate genes combinatorially with upstream transcription factors can have an important biological effect in terms of modulating the kind of output achieved.  The tools described in this lab can help us to explore molecular interactions in a network context, perhaps with the eventual goal of modeling the behaviour of a given system."

2965,Circuit Switched Networks,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-bioinformatics-capstone,"Often the function of genes that are coexpressed with a gene of unknown function can give us hints about the function of that gene. Researchers are now often using coexpression analyses as “primary screens” to identify “new” genes in biological pathways (a few examples are described in Usadel et al., 2009). Another interesting facet is whether the promoters of these sets of coexpressed genes contain any common cis-regulatory motifs. In Part A, we’ll explore the genes that are coexpressed with At3g20300, and in Part B, we’ll look for common regulatory motifs."
2966,Packet Switched Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-of-things-history?specialization=internet-of-things,"Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for a set of coexpressed gene is often useful for figuring out what that group of genes is doing. By doing such analyses with a set of coexpressed genes can we infer a role for our gene of unknown function? We'll explore this aspect in Part A, along with investigating potential pathways the gene list is involved in. In Part B, we'll use other network tools to investigate additional linkages to other genes, above and beyond those suggested by coexpression. It is sometimes useful to investigate these too! Again, we'll be using At3g20300 as our example."

A UI has to be carefully constructed to deliver this feedback, though, and it has to be responsive. Thus knowledge of the various ways UI can be implemented into a game and how it performs across various devices is key to success. This week you’ll be having a look at the various UI coordinate systems in order to determine which best supports your game’s mechanics. Then you’ll implement a basic UI, keeping the aspect ratios of varying devices in mind, all while optimizing the UI's performance. When you’re done, you’ll have a UI that, once wired up to the appropriate game code, will provide valuable feedback. But most importantly, it won’t detract from the gameplay experience."
3096,Loading and Unloading Scenes,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-level-design?specialization=unity-gameplay-programmer,"Your UI is ready to provide feedback, and for that it needs data and methods of translating that data into visuals that user can quickly absorb. From simple meters for health or time, to complex maps showing player progress or proximity, these elements need to run smoothly and accurately. If your game must be localized into multiple languages, you’ll have to plan and execute for that, too. This week you’ll delve into the scripting side of UI.  You’ll hook up last week’s UI to your gameplay, and add new features derived from scene data. All this has to perform well, which will require a look at the UI Profiler to determine how to optimize per platform. For elements that require localization, you’ll use a script to determine which assets need to be replaced. When you’re done, your UI will give you real-time feedback on your gameplay."
3097,Cinematics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-level-design?specialization=unity-gameplay-programmer,"The reason we prototype is to test an idea before fully committing to it.  Ideas that sound amazing on paper may need a lot of tweaking, or may work great except for one big loophole.  They may be completely infeasible, but through prototyping lead to something even better.  By analyzing gameplay and making adjustments where needed, you can make a good idea into an amazing game. In this last week of Rapid Prototyping, you’ll be verifying the functioning of your procedural level generation and analyzing your prototype for any other conflicts in gameplay.  Of course you’ll need to identify solutions for those conflicts should they emerge, and further prototype solutions.  Some prototypes are made only to test an idea, while many go on to become the game should the idea be successful.

They can be initiated from an app on a local device, or they can be initiated by a remote server somewhere on the internet.  Obtaining permission to post those notifications requires lots of steps, certificates, passwords etc.   We'll walk you through it all.   This week we start with a high-level overview of the iOS app lifecycle.  Then we will do three code tutorials.  The first will be the one that you will need to do the peer-review assessment.  It's a basic countdown timer that sends a notification at a specific time.  The second will show you how to make it all fancy with custom actions.  The final one will be for remote notifications.

3297,Blockchain evolution and technology concepts,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/blockchain-evolution-technology-concepts,"In this module, we discuss the definition of  the authentication, the types of authentication credentials, and the authentication process and related requirements. we learn the  Role Based Access Control, short for RBAC, which is an security approach to restricting system access to authorized users and to  help specify organization's security policies reflecting its organizational structure. We use Docker Universal Control Plan and AWS IAM access control as examples for illustrating how RBAC simplifies the access control specification and management. "
3298,Blockchain - using and securing cryptocurrencies ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/blockchain-evolution-technology-concepts,"In this module, we discuss PMI Privilege Management Infrastructure for managing the authorization of privileges within a system. We use attribute certificates as an instrument to associate access rights of the resources/services in the system to the identities or roles of the intended users of the system.  We compare the differences between the PKI, the public key infrastructure which is focused on identity management, with the PMI which is focused on the management of the privileges authorized for users.  We discuss their difference usages for the access control of the system. We then present the XACML,  which is an eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) for specifying policies. It is an attribute-based access control system (ABAC), where attributes associated with a user or action or resource are inputs into the decision of whether a given user may access a given resource in a particular way. An implementation of ABAC system using Sun’s XACML 2.0 Java reference implementation called ENFORCE is then presented as an example."
