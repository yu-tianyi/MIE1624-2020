0,Introduction to Linear Algebra and to Mathematics for Machine Learning,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"In this first module we look at how linear algebra is relevant to machine learning and data science. Then we'll wind up the module with an initial introduction to vectors. Throughout, we're focussing on developing your mathematical intuition, not of crunching through algebra or doing long pen-and-paper examples. For many of these operations, there are callable functions in Python that can do the adding up - the point is to appreciate what they do and how they work so that, when things go wrong or there are special cases, you can understand why and what to do."
1,Vectors are objects that move around space,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"In this module, we look at operations we can do with vectors - finding the modulus (size), angle between vectors (dot or inner product) and projections of one vector onto another. We can then examine how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes - the basis. That will then let us determine whether a proposed set of basis vectors are what's called 'linearly independent.' This will complete our examination of vectors, allowing us to move on to matrices in module 3 and then start to solve linear algebra problems."
2,Matrices in Linear Algebra: Objects that operate on Vectors,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"Now that we've looked at vectors, we can turn to matrices.  First we look at how to use matrices as tools to solve linear algebra problems, and as objects that transform vectors. Then we look at how to solve systems of linear equations using matrices, which will then take us on to look at inverse matrices and determinants, and to think about what the determinant really is, intuitively speaking. Finally, we'll look at cases of special matrices that mean that the determinant is zero or where the matrix isn't invertible - cases where algorithms that need to invert a matrix will fail."
3,Matrices make linear mappings,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"In Module 4, we continue our discussion of matrices; first we think about how to code up matrix multiplication and matrix operations using the Einstein Summation Convention, which is a widely used notation in more advanced linear algebra courses. Then, we look at how matrices can transform a description of a vector from one basis (set of axes) to another. This will allow us to, for example, figure out how to apply a reflection to an image and manipulate images. We'll also look at how to construct a convenient basis vector set in order to do such transformations. Then, we'll write some code to do these transformations and apply this work computationally."
4,Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Application to Data Problems,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"Eigenvectors are particular vectors that are unrotated by a transformation matrix, and eigenvalues are the amount by which the eigenvectors are stretched. These special 'eigen-things' are very useful in linear algebra and will let us examine Google's famous PageRank algorithm for presenting web search results. Then we'll apply this in code, which will wrap up the course."
5,What is calculus?,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Understanding calculus is central to understanding machine learning! You can think of calculus as simply a set of tools for analysing the relationship between functions and their inputs. Often, in machine learning, we are trying to find the inputs which enable a function to best match the data. We start this module from the basics, by recalling what a function is and where we might encounter one. Following this, we talk about the how, when sketching a function on a graph, the slope describes the rate of change of the output with respect to an input. Using this visual intuition we next derive a robust mathematical definition of a derivative, which we then use to differentiate some interesting functions. Finally, by studying a few examples, we develop four handy time saving rules that enable us to speed up differentiation for many common scenarios."
6,Multivariate calculus,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Building on the foundations of the previous module, we now generalise our calculus tools to handle multivariable systems. This means we can take a function with multiple inputs and determine the influence of each of them separately. It would not be unusual for a machine learning method to require the analysis of a function with thousands of inputs, so we will also introduce the linear algebra structures necessary for storing the results of our multivariate calculus analysis in an orderly fashion.  "
7,Multivariate chain rule and its applications,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Having seen that multivariate calculus is really no more complicated than the univariate case, we now focus on applications of the chain rule. Neural networks are one of the most popular and successful conceptual structures in machine learning. They are build up from a connected web of neurons and inspired by the structure of biological brains. The behaviour of each neuron is influenced by a set of control parameters, each of which needs to be optimised to best fit the data. The multivariate chain rule can be used to calculate the influence of each parameter of the networks, allow them to be updated during training. "
8,Taylor series and linearisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"The Taylor series is a method for re-expressing functions as polynomial series. This approach is the rational behind the use of simple linear approximations to complicated functions. In this module, we will derive the formal expression for the univariate Taylor series and discuss some important consequences of this result relevant to machine learning. Finally, we will discuss the multivariate case and see how the Jacobian and the Hessian come in to play. "
9,Intro to optimisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"If we want to find the minimum and maximum points of a function then we can use multivariate calculus to do this, say to optimise the parameters  (the space) of a function to fit some data.  First we’ll do this in one dimension and use the gradient to give us estimates of where the zero points of that function are, and then iterate in the Newton-Raphson method.  Then we’ll extend the idea to multiple dimensions by finding the gradient vector, Grad, which is the vector of the Jacobian.  This will then let us find our way to the minima and maxima in what is called the gradient descent method.  We’ll then take a moment to use Grad to find the minima and maxima along a constraint in the space, which is the Lagrange multipliers method."
10,Regression,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"In order to optimise the fitting parameters of a fitting function to the best fit for some data, we need a way to define how good our fit is.  This goodness of fit is called chi-squared, which we’ll first apply to fitting a straight line - linear regression.  Then we’ll look at how to optimise our fitting function using chi-squared in the general case using the gradient descent method. Finally, we’ll look at how to do this easily in Python in just a few lines of code, which will wrap up the course."
11,Statistics of Datasets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important dimensionality reduction algorithms in machine learning. In this course, we lay the mathematical foundations to derive and understand PCA from a geometric point of view. In this module, we learn how to summarize datasets (e.g., images) using basic statistics, such as the mean and the variance. We also look at properties of the mean and the variance when we shift or scale the original data set. We will provide mathematical intuition as well as the skills to derive the results. We will also implement our results in code (jupyter notebooks), which will allow us to practice our mathematical understand to compute averages of image data sets."
12,Inner Products,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"Data can be interpreted as vectors. Vectors allow us to talk about geometric concepts, such as lengths, distances and angles to characterise similarity between vectors. This will become important later in the course when we discuss PCA. In this module, we will introduce and practice the concept of an inner product. Inner products allow us to talk about geometric concepts in vector spaces. More specifically, we will start with the dot product (which we may still know from school) as a special case of an inner product, and then move toward a more general concept of an inner product, which play an integral part in some areas of machine learning, such as kernel machines (this includes support vector machines and Gaussian processes). We have a lot of exercises in this module to practice and understand the concept of inner products."
13,Orthogonal Projections,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"In this module, we will look at orthogonal projections of vectors, which live in a high-dimensional vector space, onto lower-dimensional subspaces. This will play an important role in the next module when we derive PCA. We will start off with a geometric motivation of what an orthogonal projection is and work our way through the corresponding derivation. We will end up with a single equation that allows us to project any vector onto a lower-dimensional subspace. However, we will also understand how this equation came about. As in the other modules, we will have both pen-and-paper practice and a small programming example with a jupyter notebook."
14,Principal Component Analysis,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"We can think of dimensionality reduction as a way of compressing data with some loss, similar to jpg or mp3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental dimensionality reduction techniques that are used in machine learning. In this module, we use the results from the first three modules of this course and derive PCA from a geometric point of view. Within this course, this module is the most challenging one, and we will go through an explicit derivation of PCA plus some coding exercises that will make us a proficient user of PCA. "
15,Basic Combinatorics,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-math-and-analyzing-social-graphs,Suppose we need to count certain objects. Can we do anything better than just list all the objects? Do we need to create a list of all our data entries to check whether we have enough data to teach our ML model? Is there a way to tell whether our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics. In this module we will give an introduction to this field that will help us to answer basic versions of the above questions.
16,Advanced Combinatorics,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-math-and-analyzing-social-graphs,"In the first week we have already considered most of the standard settings in Combinatorics, that allow us to address many counting problems. However, successful application of this knowledge on practice requires considerable experience in this kind of problems. The goal of this module is twofold. First, we study extensively more advanced combinatorial settings. We discuss in more details binomial coefficients. Also, we address one more standard setting, combinations with repetitions. The second gaol of the course is to practice counting. We will gain some experience in this by discussing various problems in Combinatorics."
17,Discrete Probability,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-math-and-analyzing-social-graphs,"Probability theory is a mathematical foundation of Statistics, the core of Data Science. During this week we study discrete probability, the first chapter of the probability theory, closely related to combinatorics. We discuss random experiments, their outcomes and events, introduce the notion of probability and some basic rules that follow immediately from the combinatorial results studied before. We also study simple probabilistic models like coin-tossing that will be used later."
18,Introduction to Graphs,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-math-and-analyzing-social-graphs,"Graphs represent objects and relations between them in a compact geometric form. Objects are represented by vertices of a graph and relations correspond to edges. Applications of graphs include geoinformational systems (vertices are cities, edges are roads), social network analysis (people and friendship relations), chemistry (graphs of molecular structure), computer network topology, and many more. During this week, we introduce basic notions of graph theory and discuss basic algorithms on graphs."
19,Basic Graph Parameters,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-math-and-analyzing-social-graphs,"Graph parameters, also called graph properties and graph invariants, are values (usually numerical), which are calculated for a given graph and depend only on its abstract structure (not, say, on a particular way of drawing the graph on a plane). Graph parameters are useful in data science, since they reduce a big amount of data (the graph) to a small one (the parameter), while conveying important information about the graph. We discuss some of the basic graph parameters in this module."
20,Graphs of Social Networks,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-math-and-analyzing-social-graphs,"In this final part of the course we discuss a Python library for working with graphs, called NetworkX. In NetworkX, one can create and modify graphs, compute graph parameters, visualize graphs, etc. We shall show how NetworkX is used to operate on graphs coming from a real-world dataset."
21,"Introduction: Numerical Sets, Functions, Limits",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"Here we introduce basic concept the calculus course could not be imagine without: function. In order to properly do it, one should say that the function is a mapping from one set to another. Thus, we start with the ideas of numerical sets and mapping, then proceeding with functions itself. Since we are particularly interested in functions' graph, we spend a lot of time discussing simplest ways to produce a complex function graph from elementary case. In the second part of the week we start our calculus journey with a discrete limit, the limit of sequences, and master skills needed to calculate them."
22,Limits and Multivariate Functions,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"Now it is time to move from discrete limits to continuous ones: in other words, in the current module we are going to discuss limits of functions. We start with the basic question: does this case sufficiently differ from the sequences? Turns out, yes, it does thanks to significant structural differences between natural and real numbers. One of those differences - the continuousness - allows us to define and calculate limits at finite  moments. We spend some time specifically on the famous important limits, then we proceed with the idea of asymptotic comparison of functions, Big- and little-o notations. To top our module with, we introduce functions of several variables and spend some time getting used to conveniently plot and interpret them, finishing up with discussion of its limits."
23,Derivatives and Linear Approximations: Singlevariate Functions,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"Since we now know limits, let us use them in order to define some instantaneous characteristics of functions starting with its slope. Thus we define function's derivative and discuss all the machinery to calculate it. Since it is a purely technical issue, you are expected to be able to do it: in order to make sure that you can find a derivative we provide a drill. This skills could be used for finding approximate values via linear approximation or during the search for extremal values. To provide an understanding of the sufficient condition of the extremum, we introduce the concept of convexity."
24,Derivatives and Linear Approximations: Multivariate Functions,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"Whilst we have discussed all linear related concepts for single variate functions, it is essential to try and generalise it for the multivariate case. Since the derivative concept is hard to stretch directly, we start with the idea of linear approximation and tangent plane; thus we introduce partial derivatives and the differentiability. We separately spend sometime discussing neural network inspired composite multivariate functions and all-mighty chain rule. Our generalisation attempt finalised with the idea of convexity in terms of the second partial derivatives."
25,"Integrals: Anti-derivative, Area under Curve",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"As we introduced the operation of differentiation, it is essential to think about the inverse procedure - the integration. We start the module with basic definition of the integration and, as usual, all techniques required to calculate wide range of the indefinite integrals, stressing out that the result is not guaranteed now. Then we proceed with the idea and formal definition of area under curve and its relation to the indefinite case - the fundamental theorem of calculus. We finish our week with the discussion of the areas of infinite figures (improper integrals) and numerical methods to assess the value of the definite integral."
26,"Optimization: Directional derivative, Extrema and Gradient Descent",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning,"As we built up impressive base by introducing various estimations of change and overall function's behaviour, it is essential to speak about general idea of the optimisation procedure. Since we already tackled it in a single variate case, we try to generalise our principles of necessary and sufficient conditions to the case of multivariate functions. Whilst it provides theoretical understanding, one should seek for faster iterative way to find an extremal point. In order to do it, we start our week with the concept of the directional derivative in order to provide and understanding of the desired direction of iterative search. Thus we produce the idea and motivation of the gradient descent, the last  and final concept in our course you are asked to master."
27,Systems of linear equations and linear classifier ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/first-steps-in-linear-algebra-for-machine-learning,"In the first week we provide an introduction to multi-dimensional geometry and matrix algebra. After that, we study methods for finding linear system solutions based on Gaussian eliminations and LU-decompositions. We illustrate the methods with Python code examples of matrix calculations."
28,Full rank decomposition and systems of linear equations,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/first-steps-in-linear-algebra-for-machine-learning,"The second week is devoted to getting to know some fundamental notions of  linear algebra, namely: vector spaces, linear independence, and basis. Next, we will discuss what a rank of a matrix is, and how it could help us decompose a matrix.  In addition, we will talk about the properties of a set of solutions for a system of linear equations. At the end of this week we will apply this theory to a scanned document processing."
29,Euclidean spaces ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/first-steps-in-linear-algebra-for-machine-learning,"In the third week, we firstly introduce coordinates in an abstract vector space. This allows us to apply the usual matrix arithmetic to abstract vectors. Next, we discuss the concept of Euclidean space which allows us to measure distances and angles in vector spaces. Then we use these measures in the least squares method to find approximate solutions of linear systems and in the linear regression model based on it. Finally, we describe the core of the most common linear classifier called Support Vector Machine. "
30,Final Project,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/first-steps-in-linear-algebra-for-machine-learning,In this week we will apply the acquired knowledge about linear regression and SVM models in this final project.  
31,Conditional probability and Independence,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-theory-statistics,"During this week we discuss conditional probability and independence of events. Sometimes we can use this definition to find probabilities. Sometimes we check that this definition fulfills to assure whether events are independent. We discuss important law of total probability, which allows us to find probability of some event when we know its conditional probabilities provided some hypotheses and probabilities of the hypotheses. We also discuss Bayes's rule which allows us to find probability of hypothesis provided that some event occurred. We demonstrate how Python can be used for calculating conditional probabilities and checking independence of events."
32,Random variables,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-theory-statistics,"Random variable denotes a value that depends on the result of some random experiment. Some natural examples of random variables come from gambling and lotteries. There are two main classes of random variables that we will consider in this course. This week we'll learn discrete random variables that take finite or countable number of values. Discrete random variables can be described by their distribution. We'll consider various discrete distributions, introduce notions of expected value and variance and learn to generate and visualize discrete random variables with Python."
33,"Systems of random variables; properties of expectation and variance, covariance and correlation.",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-theory-statistics,"Several random variables associated with the same random experiment constitute a system of random variables. To describe system of discrete random variables one can use joint distribution, which takes into account all possible combinations of values that random variables may take. We'll find some joint distributions, research their properties and introduce independence of random variables. Then we'll discuss properties of expected value and variance with respect to arithmetic operations and introduce measures of independence between random variables."
34,Continuous random variables,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-theory-statistics,"This week we'll study continuous random variables that constitute important data type in statistics and data analysis. For continuous random variables we'll define probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), see how they are linked and how sampling from random variable may be used to approximate its PDF. We'll introduce expected value, variance, covariance and correlation for continuous random variables and discuss their properties. Finally, we'll use Python to generate independent and correlated continuous random variables."
35,From random variables to statistical data. Data summarization and descriptive statistics.,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-theory-statistics,"This week we'll introduce types of statistical data and discuss models that are used to pass from statistical data to random variables. We'll introduce descriptive statistics of sample data, such as various measures of central tendency and statistical dispersion, and find correspondences between properties of random variables (population) and the sample descriptive statistics, which are essential for statistical predictions. We’ll talk about visualization of statistical data and learn to work with them in Python."
36,Correlations and visualizations,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-theory-statistics,"This week we’ll consider correlation in statistical data and find out how its' related to the level of dependance  within the data and what it means for scatter plots. We’ll consider several types of correlation suitable for different types of data and discuss difference between correlation and causation. Finally, we’ll learn to visualize dependence between numeric variables and calculate correlation with Python."
37,Data Science Fundamentals,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools?specialization=jhu-data-science,"In this module, we'll introduce and define data science and data itself. We'll also go over some of the resources that data scientists use to get help when they're stuck."

This week covers some of the more advanced graphing systems available in R: the Lattice system and the ggplot2 system. While the base graphics system provides many important tools for visualizing data, it was part of the original R system and lacks many features that may be desirable in a plotting system, particularly when visualizing high dimensional data. The Lattice and ggplot2 systems also simplify the laying out of plots making it a much less tedious process."

This week covers some of the workhorse statistical methods for exploratory analysis. These methods include clustering and dimension reduction techniques that allow you to make graphical displays of very high dimensional data (many many variables). We also cover novel ways to specify colors in R so that you can use color as an important and useful dimension when making data graphics. All of this material is covered in chapters 9-12 of my book Exploratory Data Analysis with R.

This module describes both the hardware and software architectures commonly used and some of the tradeoffs in terms of cost, reliability, performance and complexity that constrain autonomous vehicle design."
73,Module 3: Safety Assurance for Autonomous Vehicles,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-self-driving-cars,"As the self-driving domain matures, the requirement for safety assurance on public roads become more critical to self-driving developers.  You will evaluate the challenges and approaches employed to date to tackle the immense challenge of assuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in an uncontrolled public road driving environment.  "
74,Module 4: Vehicle Dynamic Modeling,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-self-driving-cars,"The first task for automating an driverless vehicle is to define a model for how the vehicle moves given steering, throttle and brake commands.  This module progresses through a sequence of increasing fidelity physics-based models that are used to design vehicle controllers and motion planners that adhere to the limits of vehicle capabilities. "
75,Module 5: Vehicle Longitudinal Control,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-self-driving-cars,"Longitudinal control of an autonomous vehicle involves tracking a speed profile along a fixed path, and can be achieved with reasonable accuracy using classic control techniques.

78,Module 0: Welcome to Course 2: State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,This module introduces you to the main concepts discussed in the course and presents the layout of the course. The module describes and motivates the problems of state estimation and localization for self-driving cars.
79,Module 1: Least Squares,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"The method of least squares, developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1795, is a well known technique for estimating parameter values from data. This module provides a review of least squares, for the cases of unweighted and weighted observations. There is a deep connection between least squares and maximum likelihood estimators (when the observations are considered to be Gaussian random variables) and this connection is established and explained. Finally, the module develops a technique to transform the traditional 'batch' least squares estimator to a recursive form, suitable for online, real-time estimation applications."
80,Module 2: State Estimation - Linear and Nonlinear Kalman Filters,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"Any engineer working on autonomous vehicles must understand the Kalman filter, first described in a paper by Rudolf Kalman in 1960. The filter has been recognized as one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century, is implemented in software that runs on your smartphone and on modern jet aircraft, and was crucial to enabling the Apollo spacecraft to reach the moon. This module derives the Kalman filter equations from a least squares perspective, for linear systems. The module also examines why the Kalman filter is the best linear unbiased estimator (that is, it is optimal in the linear case). The Kalman filter, as originally published, is a linear algorithm; however, all systems in practice are nonlinear to some degree. Shortly after the Kalman filter was developed, it was extended to nonlinear systems, resulting in an algorithm now called the ‘extended’ Kalman filter, or EKF. The EKF is the ‘bread and butter’ of state estimators, and should be in every engineer’s toolbox. This module explains how the EKF operates (i.e., through linearization) and discusses its relationship to the original Kalman filter. The module also provides an overview of the unscented Kalman filter, a more recently developed and very popular member of the Kalman filter family."
81,Module 3: GNSS/INS Sensing for Pose Estimation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"To navigate reliably, autonomous vehicles require an estimate of their pose (position and orientation) in the world (and on the road) at all times. Much like for modern aircraft, this information can be derived from a combination of GPS measurements and inertial navigation system (INS) data. This module introduces sensor models for inertial measurement units and GPS (and, more broadly, GNSS) receivers; performance and noise characteristics are reviewed. The module describes ways in which the two sensor systems can be used in combination to provide accurate and robust vehicle pose estimates."
82,Module 4: LIDAR Sensing,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensing is an enabling technology for self-driving vehicles. LIDAR sensors can ‘see’ farther than cameras and are able to provide accurate range information. This module develops a basic LIDAR sensor model and explores how LIDAR data can be used to produce point clouds (collections of 3D points in a specific reference frame). Learners will examine ways in which two LIDAR point clouds can be registered, or aligned, in order to determine how the pose of the vehicle has changed with time (i.e., the transformation between two local reference frames)."
83,Module 5: Putting It together - An Autonomous Vehicle State Estimator,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"This module combines materials from Modules 1-4 together, with the goal of developing a full vehicle state estimator. Learners will build, using data from the CARLA simulator, an error-state extended Kalman filter-based estimator that incorporates GPS, IMU, and LIDAR measurements to determine the vehicle position and orientation on the road at a high update rate. There will be an opportunity to observe what happens to the quality of the state estimate when one or more of the sensors either 'drop out' or are disabled."
84,Welcome to Course 3: Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"This module introduces the main concepts from the broad field of computer vision needed to progress through perception methods for self-driving vehicles.

86,"Module 2: Visual Features - Detection, Description and Matching",7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"Visual features are used to track motion through an environment and to recognize places in a map.  This module describes how features can be detected and tracked through a sequence of images and fused with other sources for localization as described in Course 2.  Feature extraction is also fundamental to object detection and semantic segmentation in deep networks, and this module introduces some of the feature detection methods employed in that context as well."
87,Module 3: Feedforward Neural Networks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"Deep learning is a core enabling technology for self-driving perception.

88,Module 4: 2D Object Detection,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"The two most prevalent applications of deep neural networks to self-driving are object detection, including pedestrian, cyclists and vehicles, and semantic segmentation, which associates image pixels with useful labels such as sign, light, curb, road, vehicle etc.  This module presents baseline techniques for object detection and the following module introduce semantic segmentation, both of which can be used to create a complete self-driving car perception pipeline."
89,Module 5: Semantic Segmentation,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"The second most prevalent application of deep neural networks to self-driving is semantic segmentation, which associates image pixels with useful labels such as sign, light, curb, road, vehicle etc.  The main use for segmentation is to identify the drivable surface, which aids in ground plane estimation, object detection and lane boundary assessment.  Segmentation labels are also being directly integrated into object detection as pixel masks, for static objects such as signs, lights and lanes, and moving objects such cars, trucks, bicycles and pedestrians."
90,Module 6:  Putting it together - Perception of dynamic objects in the drivable region,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"The final module of this course focuses on the implementation of a collision warning system that alerts a self-driving car about the position and category of obstacles present in their lane.  The project is comprised of three major segments: 1) Estimating the drivable space in 3D, 2) Semantic Lane Estimation and 3) Filter wrong output from object detection using semantic segmentation."

This module introduces a generic, hierarchical motion planning optimization formulation that is further expanded and implemented throughout the subsequent modules."
93,Module 2: Mapping for Planning,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/motion-planning-self-driving-cars,"The occupancy grid is a discretization of space into fixed-sized cells, each of which contains a probability that it is occupied. It is a basic data structure used throughout robotics and an alternative to storing full point clouds. This module introduces the occupancy grid and reviews the space and computation requirements of the data structure. In many cases, a 2D occupancy grid is sufficient; learners will examine ways to efficiently compress and filter 3D LIDAR scans to form 2D maps."
94,Module 3: Mission Planning in Driving Environments,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/motion-planning-self-driving-cars,"This module develops the concepts of shortest path search on graphs in order to find a sequence of road segments in a driving map that will navigate a vehicle from a current location to a destination.  The modules covers the definition of a roadmap graph with road segments, intersections and travel times, and presents Dijkstra’s and A* search for identification of the shortest path across the road network. "

"
96,Module 5: Principles of Behaviour Planning,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/motion-planning-self-driving-cars,"This module develops a basic rule-based behaviour planning system, which performs high level decision making of driving behaviours such as lane changes, passing of parked cars and progress through intersections.  The module defines a consistent set of rules that are evaluated to select preferred vehicle behaviours that restrict the set of possible paths and speed profiles to be explored in lower level planning."
97,Module 6:  Reactive Planning in Static Environments,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/motion-planning-self-driving-cars,"A reactive planner takes local information available within a sensor footprint and a global objective defined in a map coordinate frame to identify a locally feasible path to follow that is collision free and makes progress to a goal.  In this module, learners will develop a trajectory rollout and dynamic window planner, which enables path finding in arbitrary static 2D environments.  The limits of the approach for true self-driving will also be discussed."
98,Module 7: Putting it all together - Smooth Local Planning,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/motion-planning-self-driving-cars,Parameterized curves are widely used to define paths through the environment for self-driving.

Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it.   This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in.  You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters."
118,Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information."
119,Chapter Three: Conditional Code,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.  It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes ""choices""."
120,Chapter Four: Functions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"This is a relatively short chapter.   We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code."
121,Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.

125,Chapter Eight: Lists,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables.  Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable.  Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.  We call these multi-valued variables ""collections"" or ""data structures""."
126,Chapter Nine: Dictionaries,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures.  Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs.  Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory ""database"" in a single Python variable."
127,Chapter Ten: Tuples,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure.  Tuples are a simple version of lists.

This week covers some of the more advanced graphing systems available in R: the Lattice system and the ggplot2 system. While the base graphics system provides many important tools for visualizing data, it was part of the original R system and lacks many features that may be desirable in a plotting system, particularly when visualizing high dimensional data. The Lattice and ggplot2 systems also simplify the laying out of plots making it a much less tedious process."
154,Week 3,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-foundations-r,Welcome to Week 3 of Exploratory Data Analysis. This week covers some of the workhorse statistical methods for exploratory analysis. These methods include clustering and dimension reduction techniques that allow you to make graphical displays of very high dimensional data (many many variables). We also cover novel ways to specify colors in R so that you can use color as an important and useful dimension when making data graphics. All of this material is covered in chapters 9-12 of my book Exploratory Data Analysis with R.
155,Week 4,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-foundations-r,"This week, we'll look at two case studies in exploratory data analysis.

161,"Introduction, Descriptive and Predictive Analytics",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module you’ll be introduced to the Newsvendor problem, a fundamental operations problem of matching supply with demand in uncertain settings. You'll also cover the foundations of descriptive analytics for operations, learning how to use historical demand data to build forecasts for future demand.  Over the week, you’ll be introduced to underlying analytic concepts, such as random variables, descriptive statistics, common forecasting tools, and measures for judging the quality of  your forecasts."
162,"Prescriptive Analytics, Low Uncertainty",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you'll learn how to identify the best decisions in settings with low uncertainty by building optimization models and applying them to specific business challenges. During the week, you’ll use algebraic formulations to concisely express optimization problems, look at how algebraic models should be converted into a spreadsheet format, and learn how to use spreadsheet Solvers as tools for identifying the best course of action. "
163,"Predictive Analytics, Risk",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"How can you evaluate and compare decisions when their impact is uncertain? In this module you will learn how to build and interpret simulation models that can help you to evaluate complex business decisions in uncertain settings.

164,"Prescriptive Analytics, High Uncertainty ",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"This module introduces decision trees, a useful tool for evaluating decisions made under uncertainty. Using a concrete example, you'll learn how optimization, simulation, and decision trees can be used together to solve more complex business problems with high degrees of uncertainty. You'll also discover how the Newsvendor problem introduced in Week 1 can be solved with the simulation and optimization framework introduced in Weeks 2 and 3."
165,"Introduction to People Analytics, and Performance Evaluation",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you'll meet Professors Massey, Bidwell, and Haas, cover the structore and scope of the course, and dive into the first topic: Performance Evaluation. Performance evaluation plays an influential role in our work lives, whether it is used to reward or punish and/or to gather feedback. Yet its fundamental challenge is that the measures we used to evaluate performance are imperfect: we can't infer how hard or smart an employee is working based solely on outcomes. In this module, you’ll learn the four key issues in measuring performance: regression to the mean, sample size, signal independence, and process vs. outcome, and see them at work in current companies, including an extended example from the NFL. By the end of this module, you’ll understand how to separate skill from luck and learn to read noisy performance measures, so that you can go into your next performance evaluation sensitive to the role of chance, knowing your environment, and aware of the four most common biases, so that you can make more informed data-driven decisions about your company's most valuable asset: its employees."
166,Staffing,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you'll learn how to use data to better analyze the key components of the staffing cycle: hiring, internal mobility and career development, and attrition. You'll explore different analytic approaches to predicting performance for hiring and for optimizing internal mobility, to understanding and reducing turnover, and to predicting attrition. You'll also learn the critical skill of understanding causality so that you can avoid using data incorrectly. By the end of this module, you'll be able to use data to improve the quality of the decisions you make in getting the right people into the right jobs and helping them stay there, to benefit not only your organization but also employee's individual careers. "

By the end of this module, you'll will understand the four major challenges of talent analytics: context, interdependence, self-fulfilling prophecies, and reverse causality, the challenges of working with algorithms, and some practical tips for incorporating data sensitively, fairly, and effectively into your own talent assessment and development processes to make your employees and your organization more successful. In the course conclusion, you'll also learn the current challenges and future directions of the field of people analytics, so that you may begin putting employee data to work in a ways that are smarter, practical and more powerful."
169,Ratios and Forecasting,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"The topic for this week is ratio analysis and forecasting. Since ratio analysis involves financial statement numbers, I’ve included two optional videos that review financial statements and sources of financial data, in case you need a review. We will do a ratio analysis of a single company during the module. First, we’ll examine the company's strategy and business model, and then we'll look at the DuPont analysis. Next, we’ll analyze profitability and turnover ratios followed by an analysis of the liquidity ratios for the company. Once we've put together all the ratios, we can use them to forecast future financial statements. (If you’re interested in learning more, I’ve included another optional video, on valuation). By the end of this week, you’ll be able to do a ratio analysis of a company to identify the sources of its competitive advantage (or red flags of potential trouble),  and then use that information to forecast its future financial statements.  "
170,Earnings Management,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"This week we are going to examine ""earnings management"", which is the practice of trying to intentionally bias financial statements to look better than they really should look. Beginning with an overview of earnings management, we’ll cover means, motive, and opportunity: how managers actually make their earnings look better, their incentives for manipulating earnings, and how they get away with it. Then, we will investigate red flags for two different forms of revenue manipulation. Manipulating earnings through aggressive revenue recognition practices is the most common reason that companies get in trouble with government regulators for their accounting practices. Next, we will discuss red flags for manipulating earnings through aggressive expense recognition practices, which is the second most common reason that companies get in trouble for their accounting practices. By the end of this module, you’ll know how to spot earnings management and get a more accurate picture of earnings, so that you’ll be able to catch some bad guys in finance reporting!"
171,Big Data and Prediction Models,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"This week, we’ll use big data approaches to try to detect earnings management. Specifically, we're going to use prediction models to try to predict how the financial statements would look if there were no manipulation by the manager. First, we’ll look at Discretionary Accruals Models, which try to model the non-cash portion of earnings or ""accruals,"" where managers are making estimates to calculate revenues or expenses. Next, we'll talk about Discretionary Expenditure Models, which try to model the cash portion of earnings. Then we'll look at Fraud Prediction Models, which try to directly predict what types of companies are likely to commit frauds. Finally, we’ll explore something called Benford's Law, which examines the frequency with which certain numbers appear. If certain numbers appear more often than dictated by Benford's Law, it's an indication that the financial statements were potentially manipulated. These models represent the state of the art right now, and are what academics use to try to detect and predict earnings management. By the end of this module, you'll have a very strong tool kit that will help you try to detect financial statements that may have been manipulated by managers."
172,Linking Non-financial Metrics to Financial Performance,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"Linking non-financial metrics to financial performance is one of the most important things we do as managers, and also one of the most difficult. We need to forecast future financial performance, but we have to take non-financial actions to influence it. And we must be able to accurately predict the ultimate impact on financial performance of improving non-financial dimensions. In this module, we’ll examine how to uncover which non-financial performance measures predict financial results through asking fundamental questions, such as: of the hundreds of non-financial measures, which are the key drivers of financial success? How do you rank or weight non-financial measures which don’t share a common denominator?  What performance targets are desirable? Finally, we’ll look at some comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting analytics to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off in the future, and finish with some important organizational issues that commonly arise using these models. By the end of this module, you’ll know how predictive analytics can be used to determine what you should be measuring, how to weight very, very different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results, how to make trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives, and how to set performance targets for optimal financial performance."
173,Course and Specialization Overview,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-elements-user-interface-design,"Welcome! In this first module I will summarize the assignments and expectations of this course, as well as the UI/UX Design Specialization. "
174,What IS a user interface anyway?,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-elements-user-interface-design,"In this first week we will look at some basic broad concepts and contexts for user interfaces, looking at examples both on and off-screen. We will look at basic principles of interaction theory, discuss the relationship between UI and UX, and examine the relationship between coding and designing. We will discuss the roles of functionality and aesthetics in interface design and outline a ""form-first"" philosophy to user interface design. This week will focus on background information and terminology and will give you the context and vocabulary necessary before you start making great interfaces!"
175,Formal Elements of Interface Design,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-elements-user-interface-design,"This week we are going to examine the various formal elements that make up an interface. We’ll start out with the larger questions of content, context and audience that frame any UI/UX project. In other words: What is it? Who is it for? And, where does it live? And we’ll look at the big picture of overall design direction, what is often referred to as “look and feel”. From there we’ll go into detail of how the basic components of how visual design works in the context of interface design: language, shape, color, imagery, typography, and icons. These areas will be the formal building blocks you will use to create the more complex visual structure of a screen-based user interface. "
176,Active Elements of Interface Design,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-elements-user-interface-design,"This week we are going to take our static interface elements and begin to think about how a user interacts with them. In other words, how to bring these elements a stage closer to having a life on the screen. We’ll be looking at navigational conventions, such as menus, buttons, and icons in different states. Our focus will move from what the graphic interface looks like, to include how it works and how it responds to the user. By adding interactivity to our static designs, the idea is to think more deeply about the role the designer plays in shaping a user’s interactive experience."
177,Composing the Elements of Interface Design,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-elements-user-interface-design,"This week we are going to take our individual interface components and see what happens when we try to put them together into a more complex structure. We’ll be looking at how to get our components to work harmoniously as a family, figuring out how hierarchy works in the interface, and discussing conventions and expectations of contemporary interface design. We’ll also be examining how to navigate to different screens and how to build visual relationships between different kinds of content within a single site. Finally, we’ll be discussing different platforms, how to create variable content for different screen sizes, and looking at how to organize complex bodies of content into user-friendly structures."
178,Course Overview,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,Welcome! In this first module I will summarize the assignments and expectations of this course. 
179,"Ideation, Articulation, Development",5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"Your assignment at the end of this week is the first stage in a multi-step process towards developing a clickable prototype: coming up with a clearly articulated idea for an app with a specific goal in mind. So this week we will focus on how to articulate and structure your ideas and goals, how to use naming and language as a part of your app’s identity. We will also look at audience research and user centered design."
180,"Planning, Testing, Researching, Mapping",5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"This week we’re going to continue to develop, plan, and test your app idea. We’ll start by sketching out more extensive content and mapping it into a structure. To test what aspects of your app are working, we’ll look at how to create a non-visual paper prototype and work our way towards a sitemap. While you’re developing the logic of your app, you’ll also begin to develop the look and feel of it: the visual development process."
181,What Goes Where?,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"At this stage in our process we are going to take our site map, look and feel research, and user testing to the next level in order to get a more accurate static prototype. By building a wireframe of our interface, we’ll figure out what goes where, and on which pages, utilizing our user testing information to figure out the hierarchy and structure of our app. This week is about the logic and functionality of our interface, and how it’s actually going to work within the app."
182,Making it by Faking it,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"In this final week of the course, you will be taking your wireframes or app screens and make a simple functioning digital prototype to simulate the experience of interactivity. We’ll be using simple prototyping software to put your static screens into a realistic context, and simulating interaction in order to understand how your app feels, in order to troubleshoot and fix problems. This is the part of the course where all your talents come together! For me this is the most exciting part of UI/UX development, when it all starts to become real and you have a believable prototype in your hands. "

I will also talk about the differences between mobile apps and websites, and the differences between waterfall and agile approaches to UX design. Lastly, I will introduce you to the main project that you will be working on in this course and the one that follows it. You’ll be starting your first assignment at the end of the week. Last, here's something to keep in mind this week: “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”—Steve Jobs"
185,Asking Good Questions: Determining Strategy,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-strategy,"This week is all about strategy. We will talk about how to conduct research in the beginning of a project. And I will tell you about the importance of defining a target audience for your website. We’ll also discuss how to determine user needs and client needs. The strategy that you develop in this first step in the UX process will influence all decisions you make further down the line. That’s why it’s so important to take the time and think about what you want to accomplish, what the goals are, and how they might be measured when the project launches. "
186,What is in and What is Out: Outlining Scope,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-strategy,"By now you should have a pretty clear idea what your projects will be about and who your target audience is. This week we will talk about how to take the user and client needs that you have established and create a set of content and functionality requirements from them. In other words, you’re transforming your overarching goals from last week into specific requirements for your site."
187,Getting your Ducks in a Row: The Sitemap,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-strategy,"Welcome to the last week of this course. With your outline of scope in hand, you will now learn how to transform the content and functionality requirements determined last week into a navigable structure. This structure will be visualized by something called a sitemap. I’ll tell you all about sitemaps and how to create them. Along the way we will also define the term ""information architecture"". And I will introduce a tool called TreeJack, which will enable you to test your site map on actual users."
188,Course Overview,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,
189,Not Getting Caught up in the Details: Wireframes,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"This week is all about wireframes. After mapping out our strategy and scope in the previous course, Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture, this is the first time in the process that we will address the screen. Now things are going to get much more concrete as we’re starting to actually lay out elements for the user interface. This week you will learn why working on wireframes first—before designing high-fidelity mockups—is a helpful intermediate step. I’ll also talk about responsive design, navigation systems, wayfinding, common design patterns, and strategies for homepage design. And, we’ll discuss which tools are most appropriate for creating wireframes. Because creating those will be your assignment at the end of the week. "
190,"Finally, Make it Beautiful: The Mockup Phase",5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"We finally reached the point that many of you—especially if you consider yourself a visual designer—have probably been waiting for. We’ll now talk about designing the look and feel for your website. Meaning, we’re ready to design visual mockups. Finally, you’ll get to decide on colors, typefaces, and images. Maybe you’ll create a few illustrations. And your site will need a logo, too. This week, we’ll focus on designing the visual mockups of just the homepage. To find some inspiration, I’ll also have you create a mood board."
191,An Excursion to Codelandia,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"This week, you’ll continue the visual design of your websites, refining the look and feel based on peer feedback. Having worked on the homepage mockup last week, it’s time to design the remaining screens. As an important aside, I will take you on a short expedition to the land of code. Although this specialization isn’t about learning how to code, I want to at least introduce you to the technologies that make the web work. And we’ll look at a few coding examples. After all, the web is built upon certain languages—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  in order to be an effective UX designer, it is helpful to have a rudimentary understanding of these technologies. "
192,Putting it all Together: Final Presentation,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"Welcome to the final week of this course and the final week of the entire UI/UX Design Specialization. I hope that you learned a lot of new concepts, techniques, and skills that will allow you to design some amazing interactive experiences in the real world. This week, you will have time to revise any of your project components. And then I’d like you to assemble them into a presentation that will represent the culmination of all of the UX phases we covered. This should be a great project to include in your portfolio. I’ll also show you how to take your static mockups and assemble them into clickable prototypes.  "

Мы обсудим, как их настраивать и применять в задачах регрессии и классификации. В практических заданиях вы поработаете с настоящими данными и узнаете, какие проблемы в них можно обнаружить, а также попробуете делать прогнозы при помощи линейных моделей."
202,Борьба с переобучением и оценивание качества,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Вторая неделя нашего курса будет посвящена общим вопросам, с которыми приходится столкнуться в любой задаче анализа данных. Вы узнаете, что такое проблема переобучения, из-за чего она возникает, как её можно обнаружить и как с ней бороться — в частности, вы познакомитесь с кросс-валидацией, с помощью которой можно оценить способность алгоритма давать хорошие предсказания на новых данных. Далее речь пойдёт о метриках качества — без них невозможно понять, подходит ли алгоритм для решения той или иной задачи. Наконец, вы познакомитесь с библиотекой scikit-learn, которая является одним из основных инструментов современных специалистов по анализу данных."
203,Линейные модели: классификация и практические аспекты,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Добро пожаловать на третью неделю курса! Вы уже поработали с линейными моделями, научились измерять их качество и устранять переобучение с помощью регуляризации. Пришло время разобраться, почему регуляризация действительно помогает уменьшить сложность модели или произвести отбор признаков — об этом пойдёт речь в первом уроке. Там же вы познакомитесь с логистической регрессией, которая является одним из наиболее популярных методов для решения задач классификации. Далее вы узнаете о некоторых важных нюансах работы с линейными моделями: масштабировании признаков, переходе в новые признаковые пространства и т.д. Мы не только расскажем обо всём этом, но и покажем, как оно работает в Python и библиотеке scikit-learn."
204,Решающие деревья и композиции алгоритмов,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Линейные модели — очень важный и полезный, но слишком простой класс алгоритмов в машинном обучении; не во всех задачах они позволяют добиться желаемого качества. В этом модуле вы познакомитесь с новым семейством алгоритмов — решающими деревьями. Они во многом являются полной противоположностью линейных моделей. В частности, сами по себе они очень сложны и подвержены переобучению. При этом оказывается, что если объединить много деревьев в одну сложную модель, то можно получить очень качественное решение. Об этом крайне важном подходе — построении композиций решающих деревьев — мы в основном и будем говорить на этой неделе."
205,Нейронные сети и обзор методов,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Рады приветствовать вас на последней, пятой неделе курса! Мы расскажем ещё о нескольких подходах к решению задач машинного обучения, которые не были затронуты в предыдущих модулях, но при этом играют важную роль в практических задачах. Это нейронные сети, байесовские модели, метрические методы. Вы узнаете, для чего они нужны, и попробуете самостоятельно применить их в практических заданиях."
206,Кластеризация,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Добро пожаловать на курс ""Поиск структуры в данных""! В этом курсе вы узнаете про задачи машинного обучения, в которых требуется не предсказать целевую переменную, а найти некоторые внутренние закономерности в данных — например, сгруппировать объекты по схожести, или определить наиболее важные признаки. В первом модуле мы изучим задачу кластеризации, направленную на поиск групп близких объектов. Вы узнаете про основные подходы к её решению, а также узнаете, как можно выбрать хороший алгоритм кластеризации, не имея правильных ответов."
207,Понижение размерности и матричные разложения,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"В предыдущем модуле мы обсуждали, как кластеризовать объекты, а в этом модуле займёмся признаками. Нередко возникают ситуации, в которых далеко не все признаки нужны для решения задачи — или же нужны все, но при этом их слишком много. В этом случае нужно перейти в новое признаковое пространство меньшей размерности. Для этого можно либо отбирать наиболее важные признаки, либо порождать новые на основе исходных — мы обсудим оба подхода. В частности, мы разберёмся с методом главных компонент, который используется в самых разных задачах машинного обучения. Затем мы перейдём к матричным разложениям — мы изучим несколько методов, позволяющих получить приближение исходной матрицы в виде произведения нескольких матриц меньшей размерности. Такая аппроксимация часто используется в задачах машинного обучения, например, для понижения размерности данных, восстановления пропущенных значений в матрицах и построения рекомендательных систем."
208,Визуализация и поиск аномалий,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Добро пожаловать на третью неделю курса! В ней мы обсудим две задачи: обнаружение аномалий и визуализация данных. Обнаружение аномалий направлено на поиск объектов, которые являются особенными в некотором смысле. Например, это могут объекты с такими значениями признаков, которые далеки от имеющихся в обучающей выборке — вполне ожидаемо, что на таких объектах модель выдаст очень плохие прогнозы. Вы узнаете, как можно формально дать определение аномалий и с помощью каких методов можно решать задачу их поиска. Вторая задача, о которой мы поговорим — это визуализация, то есть отображение многомерной выборки в пространство размерности два или три. В теории визуализация близка к понижению размерности — но за счёт того, что нам нужно найти всего два или три признака, можно использовать очень сложные нелинейные методы."
209,Тематическое моделирование,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Люди уже много веков сохраняют свои знания в виде книг, а крупнейшая на сегодняшний день коллекция информации — Интернет — состоит из огромного количества текстов. Тексты, по сути, являются наиболее популярным видом данных, и поэтому очень важно уметь искать в них закономерности. Тематическое моделирование — это способ семантического анализа коллекции текстовых документов. Тематическая модель позволяет для каждого документа найти темы, которые его описывают, и кроме того показывает, какие слова характеризуют ту или иную тему. Другими словами, мы находим более компактное представление большого набора текстов в виде нескольких тем. С математической точки зрения тематическая модель — это еще один вид матричного разложения, где в качестве исходной матрицы выступает матрица частот слов в документах. На четвертой неделе мы поговорим о том, где применяют тематические модели, какие они бывают, как их строить и как оценивать. "
210,Интервалы и гипотезы,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/stats-for-data-analysis?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Добро пожаловать на курс ""Построение выводов по данным""! В этом модуле вы узнаете, как работают базовые статистические техники — интервальное оценивание и проверка гипотез. В тестах вас ждёт большое количество задач с реальными данными на применение этих техник."
211,АБ-тестирование,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/stats-for-data-analysis?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"Вторая неделя посвящена задачам АБ-тестирования — статистической технике, позволяющей оценить действие изменений в вашем продукте на конечного пользователя. Вы узнаете, как правильно такой эксперимент строить и какими методами анализировать. "
212,Закономерности и зависимости,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/stats-for-data-analysis?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"На этой неделе мы будем искать закономерности и выявлять зависимости. Для этого можно использовать разные методы; мы поговорим о корреляционных и регрессионных. Поскольку в основе этих методов лежит проверка большого количества гипотез, необходимо делать поправку на множественность — почему и как, вы тоже узнаете."
213,Неделя задач,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/stats-for-data-analysis?specialization=machine-learning-data-analysis,"На этой неделе мы поговорим с экспертами в прикладных областях анализа данных и узнаем, чем особенны их задачи, какие методы построения выводов они используют, и на что они советуют обращать внимание.Для прохождения курса вам нужно решить как минимум два задания, но, если вам интересно, вы можете сделать все."

228,Consumption,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-asset-management-alternative-data,"The consumption module introduces students to the basics of consumption-based alternative data. By aggregating online and offline consumer purchase activity and behavioral datasets including geolocation data (e.g., cell locations, satellite imagery etc.), transaction data (e.g.,  credit card transaction logs and point of sale data), as well as consumer interaction with brands and products on social media, researchers can learn about company performance ahead of official company earning announcements. 
Such information may be extremely useful and can provide investment and risk management advantages. This module reviews the theoretical aspects of various consumption datasets, and provides practical demonstrations of relevant data analytics."
229,Textual Analysis for Financial Applications,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-asset-management-alternative-data,"Module 2 is an introduction to text mining as well as a demonstration of how to get from data retrieval (web scraping) to financial market insights. Some of the classic text mining methodologies are covered such as vectorization of text (the bag of words approach), stop words for filtering, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Students will learn how text can be mathematically represented, and regularized/filtered to reduce noise. Measures of text-similarity will be covered in theoretical and practice sessions. Lab sessions go through examples of web scraping data, regularizing with the described techniques and finally, insights will be derived from the textual data."
230,Processing Corporate Filings,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-asset-management-alternative-data,"Module 3 is a practical extension of the text mining lessons to 10-K and 13-F, two of the most commonly researched corporate filings. This type of data can be extremely daunting when used by individual analysts due to the sheer size of the documents, but module 3 describes the methodologies for quantitatively analyzing these documents with Python code. Both the 10-K and 13-F documents are worked through, and within the lab sessions it is demonstrated how one can automatically pull this kind of data as well as define metrics around them. We investigate implementations of research in this field around similarity of given companies 10-K statements over time as well as similarity between fund holdings from the 13-F in the lab."
231,Using Media-Derived Data,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-asset-management-alternative-data,"The final module introduces both sentiment analysis in the context of textual data as well as network analysis in the context of connectivity of firms. Sentiment analysis is an avenue of potentially fruitful information that when done correctly can display what a general population might believe about a company (through for example social media) or even whether the company itself is positive or negative on future outlook (through analysis of tone in corporate filings). Network analysis, as shown in the research of course instructors and his colleagues, can be used to accurately capture how a financial network is oriented and what companies might perform well because of other firm’s mentioning them as a threat. The lab session of this module extends the corporate filings analysis to examine sentiment while also introducing a set of tweets which are then transformed into a network representation."

You will learn about their basic mechanics and control strategies and realize how careful component selection and design affect the vehicles' performance. This week also provides you with instructions on how to download and install Matlab. This software will be used throughout this course in exercises and assignments, so it is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with Matlab soon. Tutorials to help you get started are also provided in this week."
267,Geometry and Mechanics,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-flight?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Week 2 of the Robotics: Aerial Robotics course! We hope you are having a good time and learning a lot already! In this week, we will first focus on the kinematics of quadrotors. Then, you will learn how to derive the dynamic equations of motion for quadrotors. To build a better understanding on these notions, some essential mathematical tools are discussed in supplementary material lectures. In this week, you will also complete your first programming assignment on 1-D quadrotor control. If you have not done so already, please download, install, and learn about Matlab before starting the assignment."
268,Planning and Control,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-flight?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Week 3! We have developed planar and three-dimensional dynamic models of the quadrotor.

With this knowledge, you will be required to complete the second programming assignment of this course, which focuses on controlling the quadrotor in two dimensions. We encourage you to start working on the assignment soon. This week ends with a discussion on motion planning for quadrotors. "
269,Advanced Topics,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-flight?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Week 4!

Note that the last programming assignment on quadrotor control in three dimensions uses material from the previous weeks. It is strongly recommended to start the assignment as soon as possible."
270,Introduction and Graph-based Plan Methods,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-motion-planning?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Week 1! In this module, we will introduce the problem of planning routes through grids where the robot can only take on discrete positions. We can model these situations as graphs where the nodes correspond to the grid locations and the edges to routes between adjacent grid cells. We present a few algorithms that can be used to plan paths between a start node and a goal node including the breadth first search or grassfire algorithm, Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A Star procedure."
271,Configuration Space,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-motion-planning?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Week 2! In this module, we begin by introducing the concept of configuration space which is a mathematical tool that we use to think about the set of positions that our robot can attain. We then discuss the notion of configuration space obstacles which are regions in configuration space that the robot cannot take on because of obstacles or other impediments. This formulation allows us to think about path planning problems in terms of constructing trajectories for a point through configuration space. We also describe a few approaches that can be used to discretize the continuous configuration space into graphs so that we can apply graph-based tools to solve our motion planning problems."
272,Sampling-based Planning Methods ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-motion-planning?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Week 3! In this module, we introduce the concept of sample-based path planning techniques. These involve sampling points randomly in the configuration space and then forging collision free edges between neighboring sample points to form a graph that captures the structure of the robots configuration space. We will talk about Probabilistic Road Maps and Randomly Exploring Rapid Trees (RRTs) and their application to motion planning problems."
273,Artificial Potential Field Methods,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-motion-planning?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Week 4, the last week of the course! Another approach to motion planning involves constructing artificial potential fields which are designed to attract the robot to the desired goal configuration and repel it from configuration space obstacles. The robot’s motion can then be guided by considering the gradient of this potential function. In this module we will illustrate these techniques in the context of a simple two dimensional configuration space."
274,Introduction: Motivation and Background,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility?specialization=robotics,"We start with a general consideration of animals, the exemplar of mobility in nature.  This leads us to adopt the stance of bioinspiration rather than biomimicry, i.e., extracting principles rather than appearances and applying them systematically to our machines. A little more thinking about typical animal mobility leads us to focus on appendages – limbs and tails – as sources of motion. The second portion of the week offers a bit of background on the physical and mathematical foundations of limbed robotic mobility. We start with a linear spring-mass-damper system and consider the second order ordinary differential equation that describes it as a first order dynamical system. We then treat the simple pendulum – the simplest revolute kinematic limb – in the same manner just to give a taste for the nature of nonlinear dynamics that inevitably arise in robotics. We’ll finish with a treatment of stability and energy basins.Link to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc"
275,Behavioral (Templates) & Physical (Bodies),4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility?specialization=robotics,"We’ll start with behavioral components that take the form of what we call “templates:” very simple mechanisms whose motions are fundamental to the more complex limbed strategies employed by animal and robot locomotors. We’ll focus on the “compass gait” (the motion of a two spoked rimless wheel) and the spring loaded inverted pendulum – the abbreviated versions of legged walkers and legged runners, respectively.We’ll then shift over to look at the physical components of mobility.  We’ll start with the notion of physical scaling laws and then review useful materials properties and their associated figures of merit. We’ll end with a brief but crucial look at the science and technology of actuators – the all important sources of the driving forces and torques in our robots. Link to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc"
276,Anchors: Embodied Behaviors,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility?specialization=robotics,"Now we’ll put physical links and joints together and consider the geometry and the physics required to understand their coordinated motion. We’ll learn about the geometry of degrees of freedom. We’ll then go back to Newton and learn a compact way to write down the physical dynamics that describes the positions, velocities and accelerations of those degrees of freedom when forced by our actuators.Of course there are many different ways to put limbs and bodies together: again, the animals can teach us a lot as we consider the best morphology for our limbed robots. Sprawled posture runners like cockroaches have six legs which typically move in a stereotyped pattern which we will consider as a model for a hexapedal machine.  Nature’s quadrupeds have their own varied gait patterns which we will match up to various four-legged robot designs as well. Finally, we’ll consider bipedal machines, and we’ll take the opportunity to distinguish human-like robot bipeds that are almost foredoomed to be slow quasi-static machines from a number of less animal-like bipedal robots whose embrace of bioinspired principles allows them to be fast runners and jumpers. Link to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc"
277,Composition (Programming Work),4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility?specialization=robotics,"We now introduce the concept of dynamical composition, reviewing two types: a composition in time that we term “sequential”;  and composition in space that we call “parallel.” We’ll put a bit more focus into that last concept, parallel composition and review what has been done historically, and what can be guaranteed mathematically when the simple templates of week 2 are tasked to worked together “in parallel” on variously more complicated morphologies. The final section of this week’s lesson brings you to the horizons of research into legged mobility. We give examples of how the same composition can be anchored in different bodies, and, conversely, how the same body can be made to run using different compositions. We will conclude with a quick look at the ragged edge of what is known about transitional behaviors such as leaping.Link to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc"
278,Geometry of Image Formation,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-perception?specialization=robotics,"Welcome to Robotics: Perception! We will begin this course with a tutorial on the standard camera models used in computer vision. These models allow us to understand, in a geometric fashion, how light from a scene enters a camera and projects onto a 2D image. By defining these models mathematically, we will be able understand exactly how a point in 3D corresponds to a point in the image and how an image will change as we move a camera in a 3D environment. In the later modules, we will be able to use this information to perform complex perception tasks such as reconstructing 3D scenes from video."
279,Projective Transformations,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-perception?specialization=robotics,"Now that we have a good camera model, we will explore the geometry of perspective projections in depth.  We will find that this projection is the cause of the main challenge in perception, as we lose a dimension that we can no longer directly observe. In this module, we will learn about several properties of projective transformations in depth, such as vanishing points, which allow us to infer complex information beyond our basic camera model."
280,Pose Estimation,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-perception?specialization=robotics,"In this module we will be learning about feature extraction and pose estimation from two images. We will learn how to find the most salient parts of an image and track them across multiple frames (i.e. in a video sequence). We will then learn how to use features to find the position of the camera with respect to another reference frame on a plane using Homographies. We will also learn about how to make these techniques more robust, using least squares to hand noisy feature points or RANSAC to remove completely erroneous feature points."
281,Multi-View Geometry,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-perception?specialization=robotics,"Now we will use what we learned from two view geometry and extend it to sequences of images, such as a video. We will explain the fundamental geometric constraints between point features in images, the Epipolar constraint, and learn how to use it to extract the relative poses between multiple frames. We will finish by combining all this information together for the application of Structure from Motion, where we will compute the trajectory of a camera and a map throughout many frames and refine our estimates using Bundle adjustment."

351,Welcome,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Regression is one of the most important and broadly used machine learning and statistics tools out there.  It allows you to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of your data and some observed, continuous-valued response.  Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting stock prices to understanding gene regulatory networks.<p>This introduction to the course provides you with an overview of the topics we will cover and the background knowledge and resources we assume you have."
352,Simple Linear Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Our course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data.  This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"".<p> In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent.  Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions.  You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations.<p> You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house."
353,Multiple Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"The next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions.  <p> More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price').  This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value.  You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms').  You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"".   Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. <p>Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model."
354,Assessing Performance,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Having learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data.  You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing.  <p> This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment.  You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error.  For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance.  This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning.  Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. <p>The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course."
355,Ridge Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"You have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data.   In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue.  This method is called ""ridge regression"".  You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions.  To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective.  You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression.  To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". <p>You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant."
356,Feature Selection & Lasso,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"A fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model.  In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions. <p> To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features.  You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms.  Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge.  This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. <p>Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning. "
357,Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Up to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset.  In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods.  These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations.  <p> We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set.  This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors.  Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression.  Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point.  You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle.  You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior."
358,Closing Remarks,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.  We also briefly discuss some important regression techniques we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.  "
359,Welcome!,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Classification is one of the most widely used techniques in machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including sentiment analysis, ad targeting, spam detection, risk assessment, medical diagnosis and image classification. The core goal of classification is to predict a category or class y from some inputs x. Through this course, you will become familiar with the fundamental models and algorithms used in classification, as well as a number of core machine learning concepts. Rather than covering all aspects of classification, you will focus on a few core techniques, which are widely used in the real-world to get state-of-the-art performance. By following our hands-on approach, you will implement your own algorithms on multiple real-world tasks, and deeply grasp the core techniques needed to be successful with these approaches in practice. This introduction to the course provides you with an overview of the topics we will cover and the background knowledge and resources we assume you have."
360,Linear Classifiers & Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Linear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods. For example, in our sentiment analysis case-study, a linear classifier associates a coefficient with the counts of each word in the sentence. In this module, you will become proficient in this type of representation. You will focus on a particularly useful type of linear classifier called logistic regression, which, in addition to allowing you to predict a class, provides a probability associated with the prediction. These probabilities are extremely useful, since they provide a degree of confidence in the predictions. In this module, you will also be able to construct features from categorical inputs, and to tackle classification problems with more than two class (multiclass problems). You will examine the results of these techniques on a real-world product sentiment analysis task."
361,Learning Linear Classifiers,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Once familiar with linear classifiers and logistic regression, you can now dive in and write your first learning algorithm for classification. In particular, you will use gradient ascent to learn the coefficients of your classifier from data. You first will need to define the quality metric for these tasks using an approach called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). You will also become familiar with a simple technique for selecting the step size for gradient ascent. An optional, advanced part of this module will cover the derivation of the gradient for logistic regression.  You will implement your own learning algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and use it to learn a sentiment analysis classifier."
362,Overfitting & Regularization in Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"As we saw in the regression course, overfitting is perhaps the most significant challenge you will face as you apply machine learning approaches in practice. This challenge can be particularly significant for logistic regression, as you will discover in this module, since we not only risk getting an overly complex decision boundary, but your classifier can also become overly confident about the probabilities it predicts. In this module, you will investigate overfitting in classification in significant detail, and obtain broad practical insights from some interesting visualizations of the classifiers' outputs. You will then add a regularization term to your optimization to mitigate overfitting. You will investigate both L2 regularization to penalize large coefficient values, and L1 regularization to obtain additional sparsity in the coefficients. Finally, you will modify your gradient ascent algorithm to learn regularized logistic regression classifiers. You will implement your own regularized logistic regression classifier from scratch, and investigate the impact of the L2 penalty on real-world sentiment analysis data."
363,Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Along with linear classifiers, decision trees are amongst the most widely used classification techniques in the real world. This method is extremely intuitive, simple to implement and provides interpretable predictions. In this module, you will become familiar with the core decision trees representation. You will then design a simple, recursive greedy algorithm to learn decision trees from data. Finally, you will extend this approach to deal with continuous inputs, a fundamental requirement for practical problems. In this module, you will investigate a brand new case-study in the financial sector: predicting the risk associated with a bank loan. You will implement your own decision tree learning algorithm on real loan data."
364,Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Out of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. No practical implementation is possible without including approaches that mitigate this challenge. In this module, through various visualizations and investigations, you will investigate why decision trees suffer from significant overfitting problems. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees. At first, you will design algorithms that stop the learning process before the decision trees become overly complex. In an optional segment, you will design a very practical approach that learns an overly-complex tree, and then simplifies it with pruning. Your implementation will investigate the effect of these techniques on mitigating overfitting on our real-world loan data set. "
365,Handling Missing Data,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Real-world machine learning problems are fraught with missing data. That is, very often, some of the inputs are not observed for all data points. This challenge is very significant, happens in most cases, and needs to be addressed carefully to obtain great performance. And, this issue is rarely discussed in machine learning courses. In this module, you will tackle the missing data challenge head on. You will start with the two most basic techniques to convert a dataset with missing data into a clean dataset, namely skipping missing values and inputing missing values. In an advanced section, you will also design a modification of the decision tree learning algorithm that builds decisions about missing data right into the model. You will also explore these techniques in your real-data implementation.  "
366,Boosting,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"One of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting, one of the most important and practical techniques in machine learning today. This simple approach can boost the accuracy of any classifier, and is widely used in practice, e.g., it's used by more than half of the teams who win the Kaggle machine learning competitions. In this module, you will first define the ensemble classifier, where multiple models vote on the best prediction. You will then explore a boosting algorithm called  AdaBoost, which provides a great approach for boosting classifiers. Through visualizations, you will become familiar with many of the practical aspects of this techniques. You will create your very own implementation of AdaBoost, from scratch, and use it to boost the performance of your loan risk predictor on real data. "
367,Precision-Recall,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"In many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. You will explore a case-study that significantly highlights this issue: using sentiment analysis to display positive reviews on a restaurant website. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers. You will explore how the probabilities output by your classifier can be used to trade-off precision with recall, and dive into this spectrum, using precision-recall curves. In your hands-on implementation, you will compute these metrics with your learned classifier on real-world sentiment analysis data."
368,Scaling to Huge Datasets & Online Learning,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"With the advent of the internet, the growth of social media, and the embedding of sensors in the world, the magnitudes of data that our machine learning algorithms must handle have grown tremendously over the last decade. This effect is sometimes called ""Big Data"". Thus, our learning algorithms must scale to bigger and bigger datasets. In this module, you will develop a small modification of gradient ascent called stochastic gradient, which provides significant speedups in the running time of our algorithms. This simple change can drastically improve scaling, but makes the algorithm less stable and harder to use in practice. In this module, you will investigate the practical techniques needed to make stochastic gradient viable, and to thus to obtain learning algorithms that scale to huge datasets. You will also address a new kind of machine learning problem, online learning, where the data streams in over time, and we must learn the coefficients as the data arrives. This task can also be solved with stochastic gradient. You will implement your very own stochastic gradient ascent algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and evaluate it on sentiment analysis data. "
369,Welcome,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"Clustering and retrieval are some of the most high-impact machine learning tools out there.  Retrieval is used in almost every applications and device we interact with, like in providing a set of products related to one a shopper is currently considering, or a list of people you might want to connect with on a social media platform.  Clustering can be used to aid retrieval, but is a more broadly useful tool for automatically discovering structure in data, like uncovering groups of similar patients.<p>This introduction to the course provides you with an overview of the topics we will cover and the background knowledge and resources we assume you have."
370,Nearest Neighbor Search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"We start the course by considering a retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading.  We cast this problem as one of nearest neighbor search, which is a concept we have seen in the Foundations and Regression courses.  However, here, you will take a deep dive into two critical components of the algorithms: the data representation and metric for measuring similarity between pairs of datapoints.  You will examine the computational burden of the naive nearest neighbor search algorithm, and instead implement scalable alternatives using KD-trees for handling large datasets and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for providing approximate nearest neighbors, even in high-dimensional spaces.  You will explore all of these ideas on a Wikipedia dataset, comparing and contrasting the impact of the various choices you can make on the nearest neighbor results produced."
371,Clustering with k-means,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets.  Motivated by our document analysis case study, you will use clustering to discover thematic groups of articles by ""topic"".  These topics are not provided in this unsupervised learning task; rather, the idea is to output such cluster labels that can be post-facto associated with known topics like ""Science"", ""World News"", etc.  Even without such post-facto labels, you will examine how the clustering output can provide insights into the relationships between datapoints in the dataset.  The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there.  To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework.  You will show that k-means can provide an interpretable grouping of Wikipedia articles when appropriately tuned."
372,Mixture Models,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information.  In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a ""cluster"" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via ""soft assignments"".  You will explore and implement a broadly useful algorithm called expectation maximization (EM) for inferring these soft assignments, as well as the model parameters.  To gain intuition, you will first consider a visually appealing image clustering task.  You will then cluster Wikipedia articles, handling the high-dimensionality of the tf-idf document representation considered."
373,Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"The clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic.  But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics.  In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis.  You will interpret the output of LDA, and various ways the output can be utilized, like as a set of learned document features.  The mixed membership modeling ideas you learn about through LDA for document analysis carry over to many other interesting models and applications, like social network models where people have multiple affiliations.<p>Throughout this module, we introduce aspects of Bayesian modeling and a Bayesian inference algorithm called Gibbs sampling.  You will be able to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA by the end of the module."
374,Hierarchical Clustering & Closing Remarks,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.<p>We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset.  Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series.  We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.

395,Continuous Systems and Rigid Bodies,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/spacecraft-dynamics-kinetics,"The dynamical equations of motion are developed using classical Eulerian and Newtonian mechanics. Emphasis is placed on rigid body angular momentum and kinetic energy expression that are shown in a coordinate frame agnostic manner. The development begins with deformable shapes (continuous systems) which are then frozen into rigid objects, and the associated equations are thus simplified."
396,Torque Free Motion,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/spacecraft-dynamics-kinetics,"The motion of a single or dual rigid body system is explored when no external torques are acting on it.  Large scale tumbling motions are studied through polhode plots, while analytical rate solutions are explored for axi-symmetric and general spacecraft shapes.  Finally, the dual-spinner dynamical system illustrates how the associated gyroscopics can be exploited to stabilize any principal axis spin."
397,Gravity Gradients,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/spacecraft-dynamics-kinetics,"The differential gravity across a rigid body is approximated to the first order to study how it disturbs both the attitude and orbital motion. The gravity gradient relative equilibria conditions are derived, whose stability is analyzed through linearization.  "
398,Equations of Motion with Momentum Exchange Devices,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/spacecraft-dynamics-kinetics,"The equations of motion of a rigid body are developed with general momentum exchange devices included.  The development begins with looking at variable speed control moment gyros (VSCMG), which are then specialized to classical single-gimbal control moment devices (CMGs) and reaction wheels (RW)."
399,Nonlinear Stability Definitions,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonlinear-spacecraft-attitude-control,"Discusses stability definitions of nonlinear dynamical systems, and compares to the classical linear stability definitions.  The difference between local and global stability is covered.  "
400,Overview of Lyapunov Stability Theory,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonlinear-spacecraft-attitude-control,Lyapunov's direct method is employed to prove these stability properties for a nonlinear system and prove stability and convergence.  The possible function definiteness is introduced which forms the building block of Lyapunov's direct method.  Convenient prototype Lyapunov candidate functions are presented for rate- and state-error measures.
401,Attitude Control of States and Rates,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonlinear-spacecraft-attitude-control,A nonlinear 3-axis attitude pointing control law is developed and its stability is analyized using Lyapunov theory.

Finally, the 3-axis Lyapunov attitude control is developed for a spacecraft with a cluster of N reaction wheel control devices."
403,Introduction to the Mission,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capstone-mars-mission,"The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body kinematics, kinetics and control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. "
404,Orbits,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capstone-mars-mission,"Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated."
405,Reference Frame Orientation,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capstone-mars-mission,"Tasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  "
406,Attitude Evaluation and Simulator,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capstone-mars-mission,Tasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.
407,Complete the Mission,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capstone-mars-mission,"Tasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet. Please note that the time it will take you to complete this module and the requisite tasks has increased from prior modules."
408,Selecting a research question,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization?specialization=data-analysis,"We would like to welcome you to Wesleyan University's Data Analysis and Interpretation Specialization. In this session, we will discuss the basics of data analysis. Your task will be to select a data set that you would like to work with and to review available code books that help you develop your own research question. You will also set up a Tumblr blog that will allow you to reflect on these experiences, submit assignments and share your work with others throughout the course. First, you may want to check out the welcome video"
409,Writing your first program - SAS or Python,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will discuss how to write a basic program that allows you to load a data set and examine frequency distributions. Your task will be to write a program that helps you to explore the variables you have selected for your own research question. You may choose either Python or SAS. Both are made freely available, and we have created a helpful guide to support you in making the decision. Once you have selected your platform, just follow the instructions in the appropriate ""GETTING STARTED...."" file, and then check out this week's video lessons aimed at helping you write and run your first program. You need only view the lessons for one of the statistical platforms (SAS or Python)."
410,Managing Data,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will help you to make and implement even more decisions with data. Statisticians often call this task 'data management', while computer scientists like the term 'data munging'. Whatever you call it, it is a vital and ongoing process when working with data. Your task will be to write a program that manages the variables you have selected for your own research question. "
411,Visualizing Data,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization?specialization=data-analysis,In this session we will discuss descriptive statistics and get you visualizing your newly data managed variables individually and as graphs showing the relationships between them.

413,Hypothesis Testing and ANOVA,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-tools?specialization=data-analysis,"This session starts where the Data Management and Visualization course left off. Now that you have selected a data set and research question, managed your variables of interest and visualized their relationship graphically, we are ready to test those relationships statistically. The first group of videos describe the process of hypothesis testing which you will use throughout this course to test relationships between different kinds of variables (quantitative and categorical). Next, we show you how to test hypotheses in the context of Analysis of Variance (when you have one quantitative variable and one categorical variable). Your task will be to write a program that manages any additional variables you may need and runs and interprets an Analysis of Variance test. Note that if your research question does not include one quantitative variable, you can use one from your data set just to get some practice with the tool. If your research question does not include a categorical variable, you can categorize one that is quantitative."
414,Chi Square Test of Independence,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-tools?specialization=data-analysis,"This session shows you how to test hypotheses in the context of a Chi-Square Test of Independence (when you have two categorical variables). Your task will be to write a program that manages any additional variables you may need and runs and interprets a Chi-Square Test of Independence. Note that if your research question only includes quantitative variables, you can categorize those just to get some practice with the tool. "
415,Pearson Correlation,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-tools?specialization=data-analysis,"This session shows you how to test hypotheses in the context of a Pearson Correlation (when you have two quantitative variables). Your task will be to write a program that manages any additional variables you may need and runs and interprets a correlation coefficient. Note that if your research question only includes categorical variables, you can choose other variables from your data set just to get some practice with the tool. "
416,Exploring Statistical Interactions,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-tools?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will discuss the basic concept of statistical interaction (also known as moderation). In statistics, moderation occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. The effect of a moderating variable is often characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a third variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between your explanatory (X) and response (Y) variable. Your task will be to test your own research question in the context of one or more potential moderating variables. "
417,Introduction to Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"This session starts where the Data Analysis Tools course left off. This first set of videos provides you with some conceptual background about the major types of data you may work with, which will increase your competence in choosing the statistical analysis that’s most appropriate given the structure of your data, and in understanding the limitations of your data set. We also introduce you to the concept of confounding variables, which are variables that may be the reason for the association between your explanatory and response variable. Finally, you will gain experience in describing your data by writing about your sample, the study data collection procedures, and your measures and data management steps. "
418,Basics of Linear Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we discuss more about the importance of testing for confounding, and provide examples of situations in which a confounding variable can explain the association between an explanatory and response variable. In addition, now that you have statistically tested the association between an explanatory variable and your response variable, you will test and interpret this association using basic linear regression analysis for a quantitative response variable. You will also learn about how the linear regression model can be used to predict your observed response variable. Finally, we will also discuss the statistical assumptions underlying the linear regression model, and show you some best practices for coding your explanatory variablesNote that if your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use one from your data set just to get some practice with the tool."
419,Multiple Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"Multiple regression analysis is tool that allows you to expand on your research question, and conduct a more rigorous test of the association between your explanatory and response variable by adding additional quantitative and/or categorical explanatory variables to your linear regression model. In this session, you will apply and interpret a multiple regression analysis for a quantitative response variable, and will learn how to use confidence intervals to take into account error in estimating a population parameter. You will also learn how to account for nonlinear associations in a linear regression model. Finally, you will develop experience using regression diagnostic techniques to evaluate how well your multiple regression model predicts your observed response variable. Note that if you have not yet identified additional explanatory variables, you should choose at least one additional explanatory variable from your data set. When you go back to your codebooks, ask yourself a few questions like “What other variables might explain the association between my explanatory and response variable?”; “What other variables might explain more of the variability in my response variable?”, or even “What other explanatory variables might be interesting to explore?” Additional explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical, or both. Although you need only two explanatory variables to test a multiple regression model, we encourage you to identify more than one additional explanatory variable. Doing so will really allow you to experience the power of multiple regression analysis, and will increase your confidence in your ability to test and interpret more complex regression models. If your research question does not include one quantitative response variable, you can use the same quantitative response variable that you used in Module 2, or you may choose another one from your data set."
420,Logistic Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, we will discuss some things that you should keep in mind as you continue to use data analysis in the future. We will also teach also you how to test a categorical explanatory variable with more than two categories in a multiple regression analysis. Finally, we introduce you to logistic regression analysis for a binary response variable with multiple explanatory variables. Logistic regression is simply another form of the linear regression model, so the basic idea is the same as a multiple regression analysis. But, unlike the multiple regression model, the logistic regression model is designed to test binary response variables. You will gain experience testing and interpreting a logistic regression model, including using odds ratios and confidence intervals to determine the magnitude of the association between your explanatory variables and response variable.   You can use the same explanatory variables that you used to test your multiple regression model with a quantitative outcome, but your response variable needs to be binary (categorical with 2 categories). If you have a quantitative response variable, you will have to bin it into 2 categories. Alternatively, you can choose a different binary response variable from your data set that you can use to test a logistic regression model. If you have a categorical response variable with more than two categories, you will need to collapse it into two categories."
421,Decision Trees,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, you will learn about decision trees, a type of data mining algorithm that can select from among a large number of variables those and their interactions that are most important in predicting the target or response variable to be explained. Decision trees create segmentations or subgroups in the data, by applying a series of simple rules or criteria over and over again, which choose variable constellations that best predict the target variable."
422,Random Forests,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"In this session, you will learn about random forests, a type of data mining algorithm that can select from among a large number of variables those that are most important in determining the target or response variable to be explained. Unlike decision trees, the results of random forests generalize well to new data."
423,Lasso Regression,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"Lasso regression analysis is a shrinkage and variable selection method for linear regression models. The goal of lasso regression is to obtain the subset of predictors that minimizes prediction error for a quantitative response variable. The lasso does this by imposing a constraint on the model parameters that causes regression coefficients for some variables to shrink toward zero. Variables with a regression coefficient equal to zero after the shrinkage process are excluded from the model. Variables with non-zero regression coefficients variables are most strongly associated with the response variable. Explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical or both. In this session, you will apply and interpret a lasso regression analysis. You will also develop experience using k-fold cross validation to select the best fitting model and obtain a more accurate estimate of your model’s test error rate. To test a lasso regression model, you will need to identify a quantitative response variable from your data set if you haven’t already done so, and choose a few additional quantitative and categorical predictor (i.e. explanatory) variables to develop a larger pool of predictors.  Having a larger pool of predictors to test will maximize your experience with lasso regression analysis. Remember that lasso regression is a machine learning method, so your choice of additional predictors does not necessarily need to depend on a research hypothesis or theory. Take some chances, and try some new variables. The lasso regression analysis will help you determine which of your predictors are most important. Note also that if you are working with a relatively small data set, you do not need to split your data into training and test data sets. The cross-validation method you apply is designed to eliminate the need to split your data when you have a limited number of observations."
424,K-Means Cluster Analysis,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis?specialization=data-analysis,"Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning method that partitions the observations in a data set into a smaller set of clusters where each observation belongs to only one cluster. The goal of cluster analysis is to group, or cluster, observations into subsets based on their similarity of responses on multiple variables. Clustering variables should be primarily quantitative variables, but binary variables may also be included. In this session, we will show you how to use k-means cluster analysis to identify clusters of observations in your data set. You will gain experience in interpreting cluster analysis results by using graphing methods to help you determine the number of clusters to interpret, and examining clustering variable means to evaluate the cluster profiles. Finally, you will get the opportunity to validate your cluster solution by examining differences between clusters on a variable not included in your cluster analysis.  You can use the same variables that you have used in past weeks as clustering variables. If most or all of your previous explanatory variables are categorical, you should identify some additional quantitative clustering variables from your data set. Ideally, most of your clustering variables will be quantitative, although you may also include some binary variables. In addition, you will need to identify a quantitative or binary response variable from your data set that you will not include in your cluster analysis. You will use this variable to validate your clusters by evaluating whether your clusters differ significantly on this response variable using statistical methods, such as analysis of variance or chi-square analysis, which you learned about in Course 2 of the specialization (Data Analysis Tools). Note also that if you are working with a relatively small data set, you do not need to split your data into training and test data sets."

What are some examples of data science projects?  "
447,Relational Databases and the Relational Algebra,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"Relational Databases are the workhouse of large-scale data management.  Although originally motivated by problems in enterprise operations, they have proven remarkably capable for analytics as well.  But most importantly, the principles underlying relational databases are universal in managing, manipulating, and analyzing data at scale.  Even as the landscape of large-scale data systems has expanded dramatically in the last decade, relational models and languages have remained a unifying concept.  For working with large-scale data, there is no more important programming model to learn."
448,MapReduce and Parallel Dataflow Programming,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"The MapReduce programming model (as distinct from its implementations) was proposed as a simplifying abstraction for parallel manipulation of massive datasets, and remains an important concept to know when using and evaluating modern big data platforms.  "
449,NoSQL: Systems and Concepts,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"NoSQL systems are purely about scale rather than analytics, and are arguably less relevant for the practicing data scientist.  However, they occupy an important place in many practical big data platform architectures, and data scientists need to understand their limitations and strengths to use them effectively."
450,Graph Analytics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation,"Graph-structured data are increasingly common in data science contexts due to their ubiquity in modeling the communication between entities: people (social networks), computers (Internet communication), cities and countries (transportation networks), or corporations (financial transactions).  Learn the common algorithms for extracting information from graph data and how to scale them up. "

456,Privacy and Ethics,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-results,"Big Data has become closely linked to issues of privacy and ethics: As the limits on what we *can* do with data continue to evaporate, the question of what we *should* do with data becomes paramount.  Motivated in the context of case studies, you will learn the core principles of codes of conduct for data science and statistical analysis.  You will learn the limits of current theory on protecting privacy while still permitting useful statistical analysis. "
457,Reproducibility and Cloud Computing,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-results,"Science is facing a credibility crisis due to unreliable reproducibility, and as research becomes increasingly computational, the problem seems to be paradoxically getting worse.  But reproducibility is not just for academics: Data scientists who cannot share, explain, and defend their methods for others to build on are dangerous.  In this module, you will explore the importance of reproducible research and how cloud computing is offering new mechanisms for sharing code, data, environments, and even costs that are critical for practical reproducibility."
458,Project A: Blight Fight,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasci-capstone,"In this project, you will build a model to predict when a building is likely to be condemned.  The data is real, the problem is real, and the impact is real.  "

468,Welcome!,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/security?specialization=ios-development,"Welcome to this course on Networking and Security in iOS Applications.  Our focus in this course is very practitioner oriented.  We want to get you up and running using social networking integration with single sign-on, basic OAuth2 functionality, secure JSON web APIs, cryptographically secured push notifications, and secure data storage so that you can get apps into the iTunes ecosystem and out into the marketplace.  This course will have several code sessions in which we walk you through the process of building apps, some of which you will also build for peer review assignments.  Interspersed with the tutorials we will take time-outs to cover the basics of some concepts that might be mysterious without a more formal treatment.   Our hope is that you come out of this course knowing more (of course!) and having several projects that you can refer to in the future when you want to incorporate these techniques into your apps - your personal app toolbox.  The intensity picks up from the previous course in this Specialization, so get ready!"
469,Using Secure Web APIs: an Instagram Case Study,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/security?specialization=ios-development,"Now it's time to consider what we are going to do if we want to work with web services that aren't deeply integrated into iOS.  There are hundreds (thousands?!?!) of them.   Most of them require authentication via the OAuth 2.0 protocol.  In this week's lessons we will walk through an example of getting a photo from Instagram on behalf of a user.   This week is also a code tutorial in preparation for your peer review assignment, but in the middle we need to step back from coding to cover some basics:  How do we use a UIImageView?  What is OAuth 2.0 anyway?  What is JSON and how do we read it? What's the big deal about http vs https anyway?"
470,Don't be so pushy!,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/security?specialization=ios-development,"In this week we will look at several aspects of push notifications.   Those are those alerts that show up at the top of your iOS interface when an app wants to get your attention.   There are several ways that they can be initiated.  They can be initiated from an app on a local device, or they can be initiated by a remote server somewhere on the internet.  Obtaining permission to post those notifications requires lots of steps, certificates, passwords etc.   We'll walk you through it all.   This week we start with a high-level overview of the iOS app lifecycle.  Then we will do three code tutorials.  The first will be the one that you will need to do the peer-review assessment.  It's a basic countdown timer that sends a notification at a specific time.  The second will show you how to make it all fancy with custom actions.  The final one will be for remote notifications.  Since remote notifications require an Apple developer account ($$$) we won't assess you on it, but if you have one you can try it out on your own and add it to your personal app toolbox."
471,Storing Data,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/security?specialization=ios-development,In this week we look at method of securely storing data on the iOS platform called Core Data.  
472,Getting to know iOS Design Concepts,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ui?specialization=ios-development,"Welcome to Best Practices for iOS User Interface Design!  This week, we will take a deep dive into getting to know iOS design concepts.  We will cover iOS, HCI, and HIG plus complete a peer review assignment called Layout with Dynamic Constraints that, as the name suggests, uses the auto-layout engine to make dynamic user interfaces."
473,The Design Solutions that come with iOS,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ui?specialization=ios-development,"In week 2, we will discuss the design solutions that come with iOS.

474,View Controllers and Map Interfaces,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ui?specialization=ios-development,"This week, we will look at view controllers and map interfaces.  We will cover user interface construction plus complete a peer review assignment called The Basic Map View.  Who doesn't want to be able to put locations on a map!"
475,"Table Views, Core Data and User Interface Integration",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ui?specialization=ios-development,"In week 4, we will look at table views, core data, and user interface integration.  We will cover table views, table views plus core data, and you will finally learn how to put it all together.  We will end the course with a peer review assignment called To Do Manager."
476,"Location, Locomotion and Motion",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/games?specialization=ios-development,"In this week we are going to do a deep dive on the sensors in the iOS platform.  Sensors are one of the aspects of smartphones that make them a unique platform and form a bridge between the digital and physical world.  We will look at different ways of bridging that divide with location sensors (and street address look-ups via reverse geocoding), geofencing and motion sensors. This will give you the skills to write code that makes your apps aware of the world around them and possibly even react to a user’s physical movement."
477,Lights and Sounds,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/games?specialization=ios-development,"Working with light levels from the physical world is tough on iOS, but this week we will show you a way to access the ambient light around the device by leveraging the screen brightness. Then we will flip the paradigm. Instead of trying to sense the physical world, we will act in the physical world by playing sounds. We will introduce two methods of playing sounds in apps (not the only ways by any means)."
478,"Touch, Collision, Reaction",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/games?specialization=ios-development,"This week we give you the foundation for making games with SpriteKit. How do you build a game?  How do you load assets into your game?  How do you make them move and respond?  We will start with the “Hello, World” of games, “Pong”.  That will give a quick intro into how games work. Then we will return to each of the steps that we leveraged in making Pong and go into more depth explaining what we did along the way.  In the in depth tutorial we will keep a running example of a game of “Breakout” tracking along with our progress.  The focus of this style of game is on leveraging the physics engine, and detecting and responding to collisions in 2 dimensions.  We will show the student how to place sprites, react to multi-touch interaction, detect and respond to contact events."
479,Where the Action Is ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/games?specialization=ios-development,"In this final week we will explore the different actions that can be initiated by your Sprites to create dynamic games.  By leveraging the SKAction class, complicated multi-step animations, sounds and effects can be chained together without the app developer having to micro-manage their unfolding.  We will also introduce particle systems as they are a fun and efficient way to simulate effects like smoke, fire and magic. Lastly, we will show you how to interact with Game Center so that you can add social action to your games. That includes leaderboards and achievements that are visible to the user’s social network and add a fun element of competition to any game."
