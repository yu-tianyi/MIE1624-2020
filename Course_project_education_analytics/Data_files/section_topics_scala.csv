81,Welcome to the Course! ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning,"When you’re presented with a problem in industry, the first and most important step is to translate that problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The quality of your solution depends heavily on how well you do this translation. This week, you will learn the definition of MDPs, you will understand goal-directed behavior and how this can be obtained from maximizing scalar rewards, and you will also understand the difference between episodic and continuing tasks.

86,Welcome to the Course! ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods,"This week, you will learn about one of the most fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning: temporal difference (TD) learning. TD learning combines some of the features of both Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. TD methods are similar to Monte Carlo methods in that they can learn from the agent’s interaction with the world, and do not require knowledge of the model. TD methods are similar to DP methods in that they bootstrap, and thus can learn online---no waiting until the end of an episode. You will see how TD can learn more efficiently than Monte Carlo, due to bootstrapping. For this module, we first focus on TD for prediction, and discuss TD for control in the next module. This week, you will implement TD to estimate the value function for a fixed policy, in a simulated domain. "

102,Introduction to Linear Algebra and to Mathematics for Machine Learning,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"In this module, we look at operations we can do with vectors - finding the modulus (size), angle between vectors (dot or inner product) and projections of one vector onto another. We can then examine how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes - the basis. That will then let us determine whether a proposed set of basis vectors are what's called 'linearly independent.' This will complete our examination of vectors, allowing us to move on to matrices in module 3 and then start to solve linear algebra problems."
103,Vectors are objects that move around space,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"Now that we've looked at vectors, we can turn to matrices.  First we look at how to use matrices as tools to solve linear algebra problems, and as objects that transform vectors. Then we look at how to solve systems of linear equations using matrices, which will then take us on to look at inverse matrices and determinants, and to think about what the determinant really is, intuitively speaking. Finally, we'll look at cases of special matrices that mean that the determinant is zero or where the matrix isn't invertible - cases where algorithms that need to invert a matrix will fail."
104,Matrices in Linear Algebra: Objects that operate on Vectors,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"In Module 4, we continue our discussion of matrices; first we think about how to code up matrix multiplication and matrix operations using the Einstein Summation Convention, which is a widely used notation in more advanced linear algebra courses. Then, we look at how matrices can transform a description of a vector from one basis (set of axes) to another. This will allow us to, for example, figure out how to apply a reflection to an image and manipulate images. We'll also look at how to construct a convenient basis vector set in order to do such transformations. Then, we'll write some code to do these transformations and apply this work computationally."
105,Matrices make linear mappings,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning,"Eigenvectors are particular vectors that are unrotated by a transformation matrix, and eigenvalues are the amount by which the eigenvectors are stretched.

107,What is calculus?,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Building on the foundations of the previous module, we now generalise our calculus tools to handle multivariable systems. This means we can take a function with multiple inputs and determine the influence of each of them separately. It would not be unusual for a machine learning method to require the analysis of a function with thousands of inputs, so we will also introduce the linear algebra structures necessary for storing the results of our multivariate calculus analysis in an orderly fashion.  "
108,Multivariate calculus,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"Having seen that multivariate calculus is really no more complicated than the univariate case, we now focus on applications of the chain rule. Neural networks are one of the most popular and successful conceptual structures in machine learning. They are build up from a connected web of neurons and inspired by the structure of biological brains. The behaviour of each neuron is influenced by a set of control parameters, each of which needs to be optimised to best fit the data. The multivariate chain rule can be used to calculate the influence of each parameter of the networks, allow them to be updated during training. "
109,Multivariate chain rule and its applications,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"The Taylor series is a method for re-expressing functions as polynomial series. This approach is the rational behind the use of simple linear approximations to complicated functions. In this module, we will derive the formal expression for the univariate Taylor series and discuss some important consequences of this result relevant to machine learning. Finally, we will discuss the multivariate case and see how the Jacobian and the Hessian come in to play. "
110,Taylor series and linearisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"If we want to find the minimum and maximum points of a function then we can use multivariate calculus to do this, say to optimise the parameters  (the space) of a function to fit some data.  First we’ll do this in one dimension and use the gradient to give us estimates of where the zero points of that function are, and then iterate in the Newton-Raphson method.  Then we’ll extend the idea to multiple dimensions by finding the gradient vector, Grad, which is the vector of the Jacobian.  This will then let us find our way to the minima and maxima in what is called the gradient descent method.  We’ll then take a moment to use Grad to find the minima and maxima along a constraint in the space, which is the Lagrange multipliers method."
111,Intro to optimisation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning,"In order to optimise the fitting parameters of a fitting function to the best fit for some data, we need a way to define how good our fit is.  This goodness of fit is called chi-squared, which we’ll first apply to fitting a straight line - linear regression.  Then we’ll look at how to optimise our fitting function using chi-squared in the general case using the gradient descent method. Finally, we’ll look at how to do this easily in Python in just a few lines of code, which will wrap up the course."

113,Statistics of Datasets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"Data can be interpreted as vectors. Vectors allow us to talk about geometric concepts, such as lengths, distances and angles to characterise similarity between vectors. This will become important later in the course when we discuss PCA. In this module, we will introduce and practice the concept of an inner product. Inner products allow us to talk about geometric concepts in vector spaces. More specifically, we will start with the dot product (which we may still know from school) as a special case of an inner product, and then move toward a more general concept of an inner product, which play an integral part in some areas of machine learning, such as kernel machines (this includes support vector machines and Gaussian processes). We have a lot of exercises in this module to practice and understand the concept of inner products."
114,Inner Products,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning,"In this module, we will look at orthogonal projections of vectors, which live in a high-dimensional vector space, onto lower-dimensional subspaces. This will play an important role in the next module when we derive PCA. We will start off with a geometric motivation of what an orthogonal projection is and work our way through the corresponding derivation. We will end up with a single equation that allows us to project any vector onto a lower-dimensional subspace. However, we will also understand how this equation came about. As in the other modules, we will have both pen-and-paper practice and a small programming example with a jupyter notebook."

124,Welcome,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Our course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data.  This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"".<p> In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent.  Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions.  You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations.<p> You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house."
125,Simple Linear Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"The next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions.  <p> More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price').  This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value.  You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms').  You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"".   Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. <p>Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model."
126,Multiple Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Having learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data.  You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing.  <p> This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment.  You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error.  For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance.  This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning.  Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. <p>The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course."
127,Assessing Performance,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"You have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data.   In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue.  This method is called ""ridge regression"".  You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions.  To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective.  You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression.  To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". <p>You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant."
128,Ridge Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"A fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model.  In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions. <p> To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features.  You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms.  Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge.  This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. <p>Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning. "
129,Feature Selection & Lasso,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"Up to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset.  In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods.  These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations.  <p> We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set.  This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors.  Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression.  Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point.  You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle.  You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior."
130,Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression,8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.

132,Welcome!,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Linear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods. For example, in our sentiment analysis case-study, a linear classifier associates a coefficient with the counts of each word in the sentence. In this module, you will become proficient in this type of representation. You will focus on a particularly useful type of linear classifier called logistic regression, which, in addition to allowing you to predict a class, provides a probability associated with the prediction. These probabilities are extremely useful, since they provide a degree of confidence in the predictions. In this module, you will also be able to construct features from categorical inputs, and to tackle classification problems with more than two class (multiclass problems). You will examine the results of these techniques on a real-world product sentiment analysis task."
133,Linear Classifiers & Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Once familiar with linear classifiers and logistic regression, you can now dive in and write your first learning algorithm for classification. In particular, you will use gradient ascent to learn the coefficients of your classifier from data. You first will need to define the quality metric for these tasks using an approach called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). You will also become familiar with a simple technique for selecting the step size for gradient ascent. An optional, advanced part of this module will cover the derivation of the gradient for logistic regression.  You will implement your own learning algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and use it to learn a sentiment analysis classifier."
134,Learning Linear Classifiers,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"As we saw in the regression course, overfitting is perhaps the most significant challenge you will face as you apply machine learning approaches in practice. This challenge can be particularly significant for logistic regression, as you will discover in this module, since we not only risk getting an overly complex decision boundary, but your classifier can also become overly confident about the probabilities it predicts. In this module, you will investigate overfitting in classification in significant detail, and obtain broad practical insights from some interesting visualizations of the classifiers' outputs. You will then add a regularization term to your optimization to mitigate overfitting. You will investigate both L2 regularization to penalize large coefficient values, and L1 regularization to obtain additional sparsity in the coefficients. Finally, you will modify your gradient ascent algorithm to learn regularized logistic regression classifiers. You will implement your own regularized logistic regression classifier from scratch, and investigate the impact of the L2 penalty on real-world sentiment analysis data."
135,Overfitting & Regularization in Logistic Regression,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Along with linear classifiers, decision trees are amongst the most widely used classification techniques in the real world. This method is extremely intuitive, simple to implement and provides interpretable predictions. In this module, you will become familiar with the core decision trees representation. You will then design a simple, recursive greedy algorithm to learn decision trees from data. Finally, you will extend this approach to deal with continuous inputs, a fundamental requirement for practical problems. In this module, you will investigate a brand new case-study in the financial sector: predicting the risk associated with a bank loan. You will implement your own decision tree learning algorithm on real loan data."
136,Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Out of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. No practical implementation is possible without including approaches that mitigate this challenge. In this module, through various visualizations and investigations, you will investigate why decision trees suffer from significant overfitting problems. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees. At first, you will design algorithms that stop the learning process before the decision trees become overly complex. In an optional segment, you will design a very practical approach that learns an overly-complex tree, and then simplifies it with pruning. Your implementation will investigate the effect of these techniques on mitigating overfitting on our real-world loan data set. "
137,Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Real-world machine learning problems are fraught with missing data. That is, very often, some of the inputs are not observed for all data points. This challenge is very significant, happens in most cases, and needs to be addressed carefully to obtain great performance. And, this issue is rarely discussed in machine learning courses. In this module, you will tackle the missing data challenge head on. You will start with the two most basic techniques to convert a dataset with missing data into a clean dataset, namely skipping missing values and inputing missing values. In an advanced section, you will also design a modification of the decision tree learning algorithm that builds decisions about missing data right into the model. You will also explore these techniques in your real-data implementation.  "
138,Handling Missing Data,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"One of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting, one of the most important and practical techniques in machine learning today. This simple approach can boost the accuracy of any classifier, and is widely used in practice, e.g., it's used by more than half of the teams who win the Kaggle machine learning competitions. In this module, you will first define the ensemble classifier, where multiple models vote on the best prediction. You will then explore a boosting algorithm called  AdaBoost, which provides a great approach for boosting classifiers. Through visualizations, you will become familiar with many of the practical aspects of this techniques. You will create your very own implementation of AdaBoost, from scratch, and use it to boost the performance of your loan risk predictor on real data. "
139,Boosting,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"In many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. You will explore a case-study that significantly highlights this issue: using sentiment analysis to display positive reviews on a restaurant website. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers. You will explore how the probabilities output by your classifier can be used to trade-off precision with recall, and dive into this spectrum, using precision-recall curves. In your hands-on implementation, you will compute these metrics with your learned classifier on real-world sentiment analysis data."
140,Precision-Recall,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"With the advent of the internet, the growth of social media, and the embedding of sensors in the world, the magnitudes of data that our machine learning algorithms must handle have grown tremendously over the last decade. This effect is sometimes called ""Big Data"". Thus, our learning algorithms must scale to bigger and bigger datasets. In this module, you will develop a small modification of gradient ascent called stochastic gradient, which provides significant speedups in the running time of our algorithms. This simple change can drastically improve scaling, but makes the algorithm less stable and harder to use in practice. In this module, you will investigate the practical techniques needed to make stochastic gradient viable, and to thus to obtain learning algorithms that scale to huge datasets. You will also address a new kind of machine learning problem, online learning, where the data streams in over time, and we must learn the coefficients as the data arrives. This task can also be solved with stochastic gradient. You will implement your very own stochastic gradient ascent algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and evaluate it on sentiment analysis data. "
141,Scaling to Huge Datasets & Online Learning,10,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification,"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world."
142,Welcome,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"We start the course by considering a retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading.  We cast this problem as one of nearest neighbor search, which is a concept we have seen in the Foundations and Regression courses.  However, here, you will take a deep dive into two critical components of the algorithms: the data representation and metric for measuring similarity between pairs of datapoints.  You will examine the computational burden of the naive nearest neighbor search algorithm, and instead implement scalable alternatives using KD-trees for handling large datasets and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for providing approximate nearest neighbors, even in high-dimensional spaces.  You will explore all of these ideas on a Wikipedia dataset, comparing and contrasting the impact of the various choices you can make on the nearest neighbor results produced."
143,Nearest Neighbor Search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets.  Motivated by our document analysis case study, you will use clustering to discover thematic groups of articles by ""topic"".  These topics are not provided in this unsupervised learning task; rather, the idea is to output such cluster labels that can be post-facto associated with known topics like ""Science"", ""World News"", etc.  Even without such post-facto labels, you will examine how the clustering output can provide insights into the relationships between datapoints in the dataset.  The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there.  To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework.  You will show that k-means can provide an interpretable grouping of Wikipedia articles when appropriately tuned."
144,Clustering with k-means,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information.  In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a ""cluster"" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via ""soft assignments"".  You will explore and implement a broadly useful algorithm called expectation maximization (EM) for inferring these soft assignments, as well as the model parameters.  To gain intuition, you will first consider a visually appealing image clustering task.  You will then cluster Wikipedia articles, handling the high-dimensionality of the tf-idf document representation considered."
145,Mixture Models,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"The clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic.  But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics.  In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis.  You will interpret the output of LDA, and various ways the output can be utilized, like as a set of learned document features.  The mixed membership modeling ideas you learn about through LDA for document analysis carry over to many other interesting models and applications, like social network models where people have multiple affiliations.<p>Throughout this module, we introduce aspects of Bayesian modeling and a Bayesian inference algorithm called Gibbs sampling.  You will be able to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA by the end of the module."
146,Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval,"In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.<p>We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset.  Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series.  We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.

170,A New Programming Paradigm,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,Welcome to week 2 of the course! In week 1 you learned all about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning is a new programming paradigm. This week you’re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code! Check out this conversation between Laurence and Andrew where they discuss it and introduce you to Computer Vision!
171,Introduction to Computer Vision,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"Welcome to week 3! In week 2 you saw a basic Neural Network for Computer Vision. It did the job nicely, but it was a little naive in its approach. This week we’ll see how to make it better, as discussed by Laurence and Andrew here. "
172,Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"Last week you saw how to improve the results from your deep neural network using convolutions. It was a good start, but the data you used was very basic. What happens when your images are larger, or if the features aren’t always in the same place? Andrew and Laurence discuss this to prepare you for what you’ll learn this week: handling complex images!"
173,Using Real-world Images,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow,"deeplearning.ai is Andrew Ng's new venture which amongst others, strives for providing comprehensive AI education beyond borders."
174,Exploring a Larger Dataset,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"You've heard the term overfitting a number of times to this point. Overfitting is simply the concept of being over specialized in training -- namely that your model is very good at classifying what it is trained for, but not so good at classifying things that it hasn't seen. In order to generalize your model more effectively, you will of course need a greater breadth of samples to train it on. That's not always possible, but a nice potential shortcut to this is Image Augmentation, where you tweak the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers. You'll learn all about that this week!"
175,Augmentation: A technique to avoid overfitting,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as you've seen, you can be limited by the data you have on hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively. Transfer learning can help solve this -- where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that you can either use them directly, or, you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario. This is Transfer learning, and you'll look into that this week!"
176,Transfer Learning,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow,"You've come a long way, Congratulations! One more thing to do before we move off of ConvNets to the next module, and that's to go beyond binary classification.

This week you'll learn about Embeddings, where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space. With Embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space. This will begin the process of training a neural network to udnerstand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings."
179, Word Embeddings ,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"In the last couple of weeks you looked first at Tokenizing words to get numeric values from them, and then using Embeddings to group words of similar meaning depending on how they were labelled. This gave you a good, but rough, sentiment analysis -- words such as 'fun' and 'entertaining' might show up in a positive movie review, and 'boring' and 'dull' might show up in a negative one. But sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear. For example, you could have 'not fun', which of course is the opposite of 'fun'. This week you'll start digging into a variety of model formats that are used in training models to understand context in sequence!"
180,Sequence models,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow,"Taking everything that you've learned in training a neural network based on NLP, we thought it might be a bit of fun to turn the tables away from classification and use your knowledge for prediction. Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once you've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, this week you'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of it's own!"

512,Module 0: Welcome to Course 2: State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"The method of least squares, developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1795, is a well known technique for estimating parameter values from data. This module provides a review of least squares, for the cases of unweighted and weighted observations. There is a deep connection between least squares and maximum likelihood estimators (when the observations are considered to be Gaussian random variables) and this connection is established and explained. Finally, the module develops a technique to transform the traditional 'batch' least squares estimator to a recursive form, suitable for online, real-time estimation applications."
513,Module 1: Least Squares,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"Any engineer working on autonomous vehicles must understand the Kalman filter, first described in a paper by Rudolf Kalman in 1960. The filter has been recognized as one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century, is implemented in software that runs on your smartphone and on modern jet aircraft, and was crucial to enabling the Apollo spacecraft to reach the moon. This module derives the Kalman filter equations from a least squares perspective, for linear systems. The module also examines why the Kalman filter is the best linear unbiased estimator (that is, it is optimal in the linear case). The Kalman filter, as originally published, is a linear algorithm; however, all systems in practice are nonlinear to some degree. Shortly after the Kalman filter was developed, it was extended to nonlinear systems, resulting in an algorithm now called the ‘extended’ Kalman filter, or EKF. The EKF is the ‘bread and butter’ of state estimators, and should be in every engineer’s toolbox. This module explains how the EKF operates (i.e., through linearization) and discusses its relationship to the original Kalman filter. The module also provides an overview of the unscented Kalman filter, a more recently developed and very popular member of the Kalman filter family."
514,Module 2: State Estimation - Linear and Nonlinear Kalman Filters,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/state-estimation-localization-self-driving-cars,"To navigate reliably, autonomous vehicles require an estimate of their pose (position and orientation) in the world (and on the road) at all times. Much like for modern aircraft, this information can be derived from a combination of GPS measurements and inertial navigation system (INS) data. This module introduces sensor models for inertial measurement units and GPS (and, more broadly, GNSS) receivers; performance and noise characteristics are reviewed.

LIDAR sensors can ‘see’ farther than cameras and are able to provide accurate range information. This module develops a basic LIDAR sensor model and explores how LIDAR data can be used to produce point clouds (collections of 3D points in a specific reference frame). Learners will examine ways in which two LIDAR point clouds can be registered, or aligned, in order to determine how the pose of the vehicle has changed with time (i.e., the transformation between two local reference frames)."

522,Module 4: 2D Object Detection,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception-self-driving-cars,"The second most prevalent application of deep neural networks to self-driving is semantic segmentation, which associates image pixels with useful labels such as sign, light, curb, road, vehicle etc.  The main use for segmentation is to identify the drivable surface, which aids in ground plane estimation, object detection and lane boundary assessment.  Segmentation labels are also being directly integrated into object detection as pixel masks, for static objects such as signs, lights and lanes, and moving objects such cars, trucks, bicycles and pedestrians."
