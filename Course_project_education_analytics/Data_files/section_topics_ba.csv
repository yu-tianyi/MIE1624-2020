0,Introduction to Customer Analytics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-customer-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,What is Customer Analytics? How is this course structured? What will I learn in this course? What will I learn in the Business Analytics Specialization? These short videos will give you an overview of this course and the specialization; the substantive lectures begin in Week 2.
1,Descriptive Analytics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-customer-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you’ll learn what data can and can’t describe about customer behavior as well as the most effective methods for collecting data and deciding what it means.  You’ll understand the critical difference between data which describes a causal relationship and data which describes a correlative one as you explore the synergy between data and decisions, including the principles for systematically collecting and interpreting data to make better business decisions. You’ll also learn how data is used to explore a problem or question, and how to use that data to create products, marketing campaigns, and other strategies. By the end of this module, you’ll have a solid understanding of effective data collection and interpretation so that you can use the right data to make the right decision for your company or business."
2,Predictive Analytics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-customer-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"Once you’ve collected and interpreted data, what do you do with it? In this module, you’ll learn how to take the next step: how to use data about actions in the past to make to make predictions about actions in the future. You’ll examine the main tools used to predict behavior, and learn how to determine which tool is right for which decision purposes. Additionally, you’ll learn the language and the frameworks for making predictions of future behavior. At the end of this module, you’ll be able to determine what kinds of predictions you can make to create future strategies, understand the most powerful techniques for predictive models including regression analysis, and be prepared to take  full advantage of analytics to create effective data-driven business decisions."
3,Prescriptive Analytics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-customer-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"How do you turn data into action? In this module, you’ll learn how prescriptive analytics provide recommendations for actions you can take to achieve your business goals. First, you’ll explore how to ask the right questions, how to define your objectives, and how to optimize for success. You’ll also examine critical examples of prescriptive models, including how quantity is impacted by price, how to maximize revenue, how to maximize profits, and how to best use online advertising. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to define a problem, define a good objective, and explore models for optimization which take competition into account, so that you can write prescriptions for data-driven actions that create success for your company or business."
4,Application/Case Studies,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-customer-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"How do top firms put data to work? In this module, you’ll learn how successful businesses use data to create cutting-edge, customer-focused marketing practices. You’ll explore real-world examples of the five-pronged attack to apply customer analytics to marketing, starting with data collection and data exploration, moving toward building predictive models and optimization, and continuing all the way to data-driven decisions. At the end of this module, you’ll know the best way to put data to work in your own company or business, based on the most innovative and effective data-driven practices of today’s top firms."
5,"Introduction, Descriptive and Predictive Analytics",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module you’ll be introduced to the Newsvendor problem, a fundamental operations problem of matching supply with demand in uncertain settings. You'll also cover the foundations of descriptive analytics for operations, learning how to use historical demand data to build forecasts for future demand.  Over the week, you’ll be introduced to underlying analytic concepts, such as random variables, descriptive statistics, common forecasting tools, and measures for judging the quality of  your forecasts."
6,"Prescriptive Analytics, Low Uncertainty",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you'll learn how to identify the best decisions in settings with low uncertainty by building optimization models and applying them to specific business challenges. During the week, you’ll use algebraic formulations to concisely express optimization problems, look at how algebraic models should be converted into a spreadsheet format, and learn how to use spreadsheet Solvers as tools for identifying the best course of action. "
7,"Predictive Analytics, Risk",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"How can you evaluate and compare decisions when their impact is uncertain? In this module you will learn how to build and interpret simulation models that can help you to evaluate complex business decisions in uncertain settings. During the week, you will be introduced to some common measures of risk and reward, you’ll use simulation to estimate these quantities, and you’ll learn how to interpret and visualize your simulation results."
8,"Prescriptive Analytics, High Uncertainty ",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"This module introduces decision trees, a useful tool for evaluating decisions made under uncertainty. Using a concrete example, you'll learn how optimization, simulation, and decision trees can be used together to solve more complex business problems with high degrees of uncertainty. You'll also discover how the Newsvendor problem introduced in Week 1 can be solved with the simulation and optimization framework introduced in Weeks 2 and 3."
9,"Introduction to People Analytics, and Performance Evaluation",4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you'll meet Professors Massey, Bidwell, and Haas, cover the structore and scope of the course, and dive into the first topic: Performance Evaluation. Performance evaluation plays an influential role in our work lives, whether it is used to reward or punish and/or to gather feedback. Yet its fundamental challenge is that the measures we used to evaluate performance are imperfect: we can't infer how hard or smart an employee is working based solely on outcomes. In this module, you’ll learn the four key issues in measuring performance: regression to the mean, sample size, signal independence, and process vs. outcome, and see them at work in current companies, including an extended example from the NFL. By the end of this module, you’ll understand how to separate skill from luck and learn to read noisy performance measures, so that you can go into your next performance evaluation sensitive to the role of chance, knowing your environment, and aware of the four most common biases, so that you can make more informed data-driven decisions about your company's most valuable asset: its employees."
10,Staffing,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you'll learn how to use data to better analyze the key components of the staffing cycle: hiring, internal mobility and career development, and attrition. You'll explore different analytic approaches to predicting performance for hiring and for optimizing internal mobility, to understanding and reducing turnover, and to predicting attrition. You'll also learn the critical skill of understanding causality so that you can avoid using data incorrectly. By the end of this module, you'll be able to use data to improve the quality of the decisions you make in getting the right people into the right jobs and helping them stay there, to benefit not only your organization but also employee's individual careers. "
11,Collaboration,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you'll learn the basic principles behind using people analytics to improve collaboration between employees inside an organization so they can work together more successfully. You'll explore how data is used to describe, map, and evaluate collaboration networks, as well as how to intervene in collaboration networks to improve collaboration using examples from real-world companies. By the end of this module, you'll know how to deploy the tools and techniques of organizational network analysis to understand and improve collaboration patterns inside your organization to make your organization, and the people working within in it, more productive, effective, and successful. "
12,Talent Management and Future Directions,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"In this module, you explore talent analytics: how data may be used in talent assessment and development to maximize employee ability. You'll learn how to use data to move from performance evaluation to a more deeper analysis of employee evaluation so that you may be able to improve the both the effectiveness and the equitability of the promotion process at your firm. By the end of this module, you'll will understand the four major challenges of talent analytics: context, interdependence, self-fulfilling prophecies, and reverse causality, the challenges of working with algorithms, and some practical tips for incorporating data sensitively, fairly, and effectively into your own talent assessment and development processes to make your employees and your organization more successful. In the course conclusion, you'll also learn the current challenges and future directions of the field of people analytics, so that you may begin putting employee data to work in a ways that are smarter, practical and more powerful."
13,Ratios and Forecasting,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"The topic for this week is ratio analysis and forecasting. Since ratio analysis involves financial statement numbers, I’ve included two optional videos that review financial statements and sources of financial data, in case you need a review. We will do a ratio analysis of a single company during the module. First, we’ll examine the company's strategy and business model, and then we'll look at the DuPont analysis. Next, we’ll analyze profitability and turnover ratios followed by an analysis of the liquidity ratios for the company. Once we've put together all the ratios, we can use them to forecast future financial statements. (If you’re interested in learning more, I’ve included another optional video, on valuation). By the end of this week, you’ll be able to do a ratio analysis of a company to identify the sources of its competitive advantage (or red flags of potential trouble),  and then use that information to forecast its future financial statements.  "
14,Earnings Management,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"This week we are going to examine ""earnings management"", which is the practice of trying to intentionally bias financial statements to look better than they really should look. Beginning with an overview of earnings management, we’ll cover means, motive, and opportunity: how managers actually make their earnings look better, their incentives for manipulating earnings, and how they get away with it. Then, we will investigate red flags for two different forms of revenue manipulation. Manipulating earnings through aggressive revenue recognition practices is the most common reason that companies get in trouble with government regulators for their accounting practices. Next, we will discuss red flags for manipulating earnings through aggressive expense recognition practices, which is the second most common reason that companies get in trouble for their accounting practices. By the end of this module, you’ll know how to spot earnings management and get a more accurate picture of earnings, so that you’ll be able to catch some bad guys in finance reporting!"
15,Big Data and Prediction Models,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"This week, we’ll use big data approaches to try to detect earnings management. Specifically, we're going to use prediction models to try to predict how the financial statements would look if there were no manipulation by the manager. First, we’ll look at Discretionary Accruals Models, which try to model the non-cash portion of earnings or ""accruals,"" where managers are making estimates to calculate revenues or expenses. Next, we'll talk about Discretionary Expenditure Models, which try to model the cash portion of earnings. Then we'll look at Fraud Prediction Models, which try to directly predict what types of companies are likely to commit frauds. Finally, we’ll explore something called Benford's Law, which examines the frequency with which certain numbers appear. If certain numbers appear more often than dictated by Benford's Law, it's an indication that the financial statements were potentially manipulated. These models represent the state of the art right now, and are what academics use to try to detect and predict earnings management. By the end of this module, you'll have a very strong tool kit that will help you try to detect financial statements that may have been manipulated by managers."
16,Linking Non-financial Metrics to Financial Performance,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics?specialization=business-analytics,"Linking non-financial metrics to financial performance is one of the most important things we do as managers, and also one of the most difficult. We need to forecast future financial performance, but we have to take non-financial actions to influence it. And we must be able to accurately predict the ultimate impact on financial performance of improving non-financial dimensions. In this module, we’ll examine how to uncover which non-financial performance measures predict financial results through asking fundamental questions, such as: of the hundreds of non-financial measures, which are the key drivers of financial success? How do you rank or weight non-financial measures which don’t share a common denominator?  What performance targets are desirable? Finally, we’ll look at some comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting analytics to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off in the future, and finish with some important organizational issues that commonly arise using these models. By the end of this module, you’ll know how predictive analytics can be used to determine what you should be measuring, how to weight very, very different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results, how to make trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives, and how to set performance targets for optimal financial performance."
17, Module 1: Capstone Project Topic - The Problem of Adblocking,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-capstone-analytics,"The Business Analytics Specialization was designed to help you learn how to think about using data in making big (and small) business decisions. In this Capstone project, you'll be asked to create a strategy for a fictional digital search engine and content provider, GoYaFace, Inc. (often abbreviated as “GYF”). The strategy will be used in responding to the increasing popularity and availability of “adblocking” software, which could have significant negative repercussions for GYF’s business.  You are to assume the role of the leader of the Digital Advertising Tactics and Action (“DATA”) Team at GYF, which has been assigned the job of formulating GYF’s strategy in responding to the threat of adblocking.  Your task is to develop a strategy that will be recommended to GYF’s senior leadership.  Using what you've learned about business analytics, you'll (i) create a detailed problem statement focusing on GYF’s ad-buying customers (Module 2), (ii) develop a strategy (Module 3), (iii) describe the anticipated effects of the strategy (Module 4), and (iv) form a plan for measuring the effects of your strategy (Module 4).  You'll then put these four pieces together into a final project (Module 5).  First, please read the full description of the project in the “Project Description” link below, and then look at the background information about adblockers and the “GYF Company Profile” link in the content for Module 1. When you are ready to begin the first assignment, please move on to Module 2: Defining the Problem."
18,Module 2:  Defining the Problem,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-capstone-analytics,"In Module 2, you'll define the problem adblockers poses for GYF. GYF is intended to be a composite of leading internet platform and content providers who derive substantial revenues from mobile advertising like Google, Yahoo, and Facebook, so you should frame your research around the real-world problems these companies have faced and are facing. Defining the problem thoroughly will have a direct impact on how successful your strategy will be received by your peers. The more deeply you consider the effects of adblockers on the companies that buy advertising space from GYF, the more appropriate your overall strategy is likely to be. Please use the resources below to find out more about the problem, and then create your Problem Statement and submit it for peer review below. You can and should draw from all of the Business Analytics Specialization courses, but your Problem Statement should focus on how adblockers might adversely affect GYF’s relationship with the companies that pay GYF to place advertisements on GYF’s mobile applications and content. You should consider the issue of causality in your Problem Statement - we've included some lectures from the underlying courses to refresh you on that topci.  And you are strongly encouraged to complete and include a response to Application Exercise 1 (see link below) as part of your Problem Statement."
19,Module 3:  Your Strategy,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-capstone-analytics,"In Module 3, you will focus on creating your recommended strategy for GYF to address adblockers. Your strategy does not have to be lengthy, but it must be clear, and it must address the problem. (Hint: if you have a clearly defined problem, your strategy is much more likely to be clearly defined as well). You'll be submitting your strategy for peer review, and then also reviewing the work of at least 3 of your peers. It's OK if reviewing the strategies of other learners in this course gives you further ideas for revising your own strategy. One of the primary benefits of peer review is to expand the range of feedback you can get, and we designed this Module around peer review so that you can get as much feedback as possible before moving on to the next phase of the project.  You may find the resources and lectures below helpful in formulating your strategy and considering how data can be leveraged and appropriately understood.  You are strongly encouraged to complete and include your response to Application Exercise 2 as part of your Strategy.  "
20,Module 4:  Effects of Your Strategy/Measuring these Effects,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-capstone-analytics,"Module 4 was designed to give you the opportunity to focus on the effects of your strategy. Effects and Measurement can be often overlooked in strategy development; creating a thoughtful and thorough plan for measuring the effects will improve your final project tremendously. In this part of the project, you will describe two events: what you think will happen and how you will measure it. Look to the courses in the Business Analytics Specialization to see what kind of data companies use to measure effects to create a measurement plan of your own. You are strongly encouraged to complete and include your responses to Application Exercises 3 and 4 as part of your Effects and Measurement components.  You may create a scenario (Operations Analytics) to predict some of the intended effects of your strategy, either following the outline of Application Exercise 3, or of your own design.  Once you submit your own plan for effects and measurement, please review the work of at least three of your peers. You may find new ideas, or new ways of looking at data and measurement from this exercise.  We encourage you to incorporate what you've learned into your final submission!"
21,Module 5:  Final Project Submission,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-capstone-analytics,"In this final Module, you will combine the four revised elements of your presentation (Problem Statement, Strategy, Effects, and Measurement, including any responses to the Application Exercises you've completed) into one presentation and submit it for peer review. You'll then be asked to review the work of at least three of your peers. Once you have gotten feedback on your plan, you may use it as an example of strategic thinking at your current job, or as a work sample when you are applying for a new one. A successful strategic analysis which describes the use of data-driven decision making will make you much more marketable in almost any field. Good luck!"
22,About This Specialization and Course ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics?specialization=excel-mysql,"This Coursera Specialization: Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business, is about how 'Big Data' interacts with business, and how to use data analytics to create value for businesses. This specialization consists of four courses and a final Capstone Project, where you will apply your skills to real-world business process.

Digital companies like Amazon, Uber and Airbnb are transforming entire industries through their creative use of big data. You’ll understand why these companies are so disruptive, and how they use data-analytics techniques to out-compete traditional companies.To get started, please begin with the video 'About This Specialization.'I hope you enjoy this week's materials!"
23,Introducing Business Metrics,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics?specialization=excel-mysql,"Welcome! This week we will explore business metrics - the critical numbers that help companies figure out how to survive and thrive. Inside every pile of data is a vital metric trying to get out! By the end of this week, you will be able to: distinguish business metrics from mere business data; identify critical business metrics such as cash flow, profitability, and online retail marketing metrics;  distinguish revenue, profitability and risk metrics; and distinguish traditional from dynamic metrics. Included in this week’s course materials is a Cash Flow and P&L statement for Egger’s Roast Coffee, as a supplemental document, so be sure to review it carefully and refer to the glossary for key information. "
24,Working in the Business Data Analytics Marketplace,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics?specialization=excel-mysql,"Welcome!  This week, we will meet some great people - all former students of mine - now working at super-interesting and exciting jobs as business analysts, business data analysts, or data scientists. We’ll explore what they do, how their role relates to big data, and the skills they needed to get hired! Our hope is this information will give you a better understanding of the type of data-related job you might apply for once you've completed this specialization, and a sense of the type of company you would find most appealing to work for. By the end of this week, you will be able to:  differentiate among different job roles within a company that work with data; identify how each role works with data; and describe the skills required to perform each job role. You will differentiate how different types of companies relate to big data culture, and rank any company according to a 20-item checklist. You will also learn to differentiate how different types of companies relate to big data culture. Included in this week’s materials is a 20-item checklist to rank companies. This week also includes in-video polls so you can see how others are ranking their businesses."
25,Going Deeper into Business Metrics ,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics?specialization=excel-mysql,"Welcome! This week we’re going to go deeper into the critically-important metrics for web marketing - metrics every type of business needs to understand in order to survive. We’ll dive into the 'vertical' market of financial services - where digital companies are threatening to take away the market from traditional 'brick-and- mortar' companies.By the end of this week, you will be able to: Identify critical business metrics for all companies engaged in web-based marketing; and identify critical business metrics for financial services companies. You’ll find additional website links that expand some of the course materials covered in this week’s video lectures. "
26,Applying Business Metrics to a Business Case Study,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics?specialization=excel-mysql,"This week contains the final course assignment, a peer assessment in which you will identify business metrics of interest in a case example, describe those metrics, and propose a business process change that could be supported by the metric chosen."
27,About This Course,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"This course will prepare you to design and implement realistic predictive models based on data. In the Final Project (module 6) you will assume the role of a business data analyst for a bank, and develop two different predictive models to determine which applicants for credit cards should be accepted and which rejected.  Your first model will focus on minimizing default risk, and your second on maximizing bank profits. The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.The second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty.  Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information, and confidence intervals for linear regression. All the data you need is provided within the course, and all assignments are designed to be done in MS Excel. The course will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions, and you’ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality you might need in future (module 1). The course does not cover Visual Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments. All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions. You will emerge with substantial vocabulary and practical knowledge of how to apply business data analysis methods based on binary classification (module 2), information theory and entropy measures (module 3), and linear regression (module 4 and 5), all using no software tools more  complex than Excel. "
28,Excel Essentials for Beginners,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"In this module, will explore the essential Excel skills to address typical business situations you may encounter in the future. The Excel vocabulary and functions taught throughout this module make it possible for you to understand the additional explanatory Excel spreadsheets that accompany later videos in this course. "
29,Binary Classification,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"Separating collections into two categories, such as “buy this stock, don’t but that stock” or “target this customer with a special offer, but not that one” is the ultimate goal of most business data-analysis projects. There is a specialized vocabulary of measures for comparing and optimizing the performance of the algorithms used to classify collections into two groups. You will learn how and why to apply these different metrics, including how to calculate the all-important AUC: the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. "
30,Information Measures,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"In this module, you will learn how to calculate and apply the vitally useful uncertainty metric known as “entropy.” In contrast to the more familiar “probability” that represents the uncertainty that a single outcome will occur, “entropy” quantifies the aggregate uncertainty of all possible outcomes.The entropy measure provides the framework for accountability in data-analytic work. Entropy gives you the power to quantify the uncertainty of future outcomes relevant to your business twice: using the best-available estimates before you begin a project, and then again after you have built a predictive model.
The difference between the two measures is the Information Gain contributed by your work."
31,Linear Regression,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"The Linear Correlation measure is a much richer metric for evaluating associations than is commonly realized. You can use it to quantify how much a linear model reduces uncertainty.  When used to forecast future outcomes, it can be converted into a “point estimate” plus a “confidence interval,” or converted into an information gain measure. You will develop a fluent knowledge of these concepts and the many valuable uses to which linear regression is put in business data analysis. This module also teaches how to use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to solve practical problems. The two topics are closely related because regression and the CLT both make use of a special family of probability distributions called “Gaussians.” You will learn everything you need to know to work with Gaussians in these and other contexts. "
32,Additional Skills for Model Building,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"This module gives you additional valuable concepts and skills related to building high-quality models. As you know, a “model” is a description of a process applied to available data (inputs) that produces an estimate of a future and as yet unknown outcome as output. 
Very often, models for outputs take the form of a probability distribution. This module covers how to estimate probability distributions from data (a “probability histogram”), and how to describe and generate the most useful probability distributions used by data scientists. It also covers in detail how to develop a binary classification model with parameters optimized to maximize the AUC, and how to apply linear regression models when your input consists of multiple types of data for each event. 
The module concludes with an explanation of “over-fitting” which is the main reason that apparently good predictive models often fail in real life business settings. We conclude with some tips for how you can avoid over-fitting in you own predictive model for the final project – and in real life."
33,Final Course Project,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-excel?specialization=excel-mysql,"The final course project is a comprehensive assessment covering all of the course material, and consists of four quizzes and a peer review assignment.  For quiz one and quiz two, there are learning points that explain components of the quiz.  These learning points will unlock only after you complete the quiz with a passing grade. Before you start, please read through the final project instructions.  From past student experience, the final project which includes all the quizzes and peer assessment, takes anywhere from 10-12 hours."

Finally, we will focus on the flexibilities in projects, how to value them and how they affect the decision to accept or reject projects."
226,Introduction and Real Options,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-project-management?specialization=business-technology-managment,"The first topic in this module is Introduction and Overview of the course.  We first define what a project is and give some examples of IT projects. The three parameters or metrics for project management are presented. The importance of project management is then discussed. The concept of project life cycle and the four phases of project life cycle are presented. The topics to be covered in the four different modules are also given.The second topic in this module is on the Organization Structure for projects. Three different forms of Organization structure and their implications for project management including the project manager are discussed in detail. Communication plan and its importance for project management are then presented.The next topic in this module is about the use of real options for project selection. The material in this topic is well developed for valuation of financial assets but its use for project selection is a relatively new development. We define what options are and give a taxonomy of real options. In future, ‘Options Thinking” and valuation of real options are expected to play an important role in project selection. Next, we discuss six case studies where options thinking played a dominant role in accepting / modifying the projects. Valuation of real options is in its infancy and for the for valuation of real options is easily understand and we present a simple example to illustrate the approach.Towards the end of the module, we present some practical aspects pertaining to the concepts covered. This is done through a Q & A format with Mr. Prashun Dutta, Advisor - Gaiga Smart Cities "
227,Project Network Scheduling and Crashing,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-project-management?specialization=business-technology-managment,"This module will cover Project Planning which is the second phase of Project Life Cycle. We first look at what Project Scope is and what scope creep refers to. Work Breakdown structure leading to work packages or activities with the associated precedence relationships are treated in detail.  The next topic is about scheduling of the activities which requires the estimation of activity durations. The estimation of duration, cost and resource required for the identified activities are covered later as a separate topic. Here, using the same software development project, assuming that the durations of the activities have been estimated and ignoring the resource requirements for the different activities, we show how a schedule for the activities can be arrived at. The next topic is the estimation of durations, cost and resources required for the activities. Three popular estimating procedures are covered. The next topic covers the various reasons, possible benefits and different alternatives for reducing project duration. We then discuss in detail, one approach to reducing project duration viz. by incurring additional incremental direct cost for reducing activity durations and show how we can arrive at the least incremental direct cost for any specified project completion time. While the approach presented is conceptually sound it is difficult to implement for large projects. So, the next topic covers a linear programming approach to solve the same problem even if the project under consideration is large in terms of the number of activities.   As in the previous module, towards the end of this module also, we present some practical aspects pertaining to the concepts covered. This again is done through a Q & A format with Mr. Prashun Dutta, Advisor - Gaiga Smart Cities"
228,Resource Scheduling and Risk Management,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-project-management?specialization=business-technology-managment,"Activities in a project typically require the use of resources such as people, material, equipment and working capital. The schedule for the activities that we had calculated in the previous module assumes that adequate resources are available as and when required. However, in practice often adequate resources may not be available as required and the schedule may have to be modified. There are two types of problems when resource requirements are considered. One is the Resource Smoothing Problem and the other is the Resource Limitation problem. In the first one, i.e. the Resource Smoothing Problem, although the resources are available as and when required, we would want to find a schedule that “smoothes” the use of resources without delaying the project completion time.  Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is the next topic dealt with in this module.  CCPM has not gained universal acceptance although it is being used by some organizations with positive results. CCPM places a lot of emphasis on aggressive estimation of activity durations and provides for buffers to take care of some delays.  With Risk Management, we first define what risk is and then discuss the risk management process including risk identification, risk assessment and various ways of reducing exposure to risk.

El producto era genial, pero fue una compleja estrategia de marketing la que finalmente lo llevó por buen camino.

Entonces, ¿qué podemos hacer para sostener el valor en el tiempo? Esta semana hablaremos de dos conceptos centrales para sostenerlo: el valor para el cliente y el valor de vida del cliente (customer lifetime value).

262,The building blocks,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-accounting,"Welcome to the first week of Know Your Numbers 1. This week, we are going to take on the basics of two important topics in MBA programs: accounting and finance. Accounting is primarily concerned with the classification of financial values (expressed as assets, liabilities, and equity), while finance expands on this to consider the valuation of our assets and the way that we have funded them through debt or equity. As such, the two concepts are closely related, though their focal points differ somewhat.  "
263,Ratios and data: Why and how,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-accounting,"Welcome to Week 2! This week, we are going to focus on some of the most useful ratios and measurements that are commonly used in business, so that you can take your skills in this area and apply them to the rest of your studies, and more importantly, your career and your life. These will serve as a starting point for looking into quantitative analysis for your own organisation as well as for considering the strategic choices available to competitors, or other firms in which you may have an interest. "
264,Strategy and accounting,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-accounting,"During this week, we shift our focus from financial analysis and ratios to broader questions regarding the strategy of our organisation. The reason we do this is so that we have a first glance into what links exist between qualitative change and the downstream quantitative impacts that we can expect."
265,Budgeting and forecasting,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-accounting,"This week, we begin to explore the connection between strategy, tactics, operations, and the numbers that demonstrate the financial health of our organisation. The role of management accounting in this context is also drawn into the discussion here, as is the nature of our role as managers in having to interpret technical accounting analysis on one hand, and influence strategic change on another."
266,Modelling financial performance,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-accounting,"This week, we are shifting up a gear as we start to consider the use of financials to model the financial performance characteristics of an organisation into the future. we are getting our hands on some basic tools that will help us to build the frameworks and the fundamental techniques that will be used for financial projections, and even business valuation, in the future. This starts with a clear understanding of financial and cash flow performance, as we have explored in previous weeks."
267,Corporate governance and accounting,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-accounting,"As we conclude our first Know Your Numbers course, our focus shifts towards the application of concepts like agency theory, and some examples of where the pursuit of financial performance alone has led to the failure of an organisation. By exploring such failures in some detail, we are better equipped to avoid similar occurrences in the future, as well as to find ways to manage and govern organisations successfully with regard to a multitude of stakeholders."
268,Financial management decisions,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance-know-your-numbers-2,"In Week 1 we have three main objectives. Firstly, we review the main types of decisions made when management and owners allocate capital within a business. Secondly, we will discuss why it is important to bring the shareholder perspective to these decisions. Thirdly, to introduce key terminology around the business life cycle and different types of ownership models, including venture capital, private equity and listed companies."
269,Time value of money and discounted cash flow analysis,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance-know-your-numbers-2,"This week we will consider the time value of money. We will learn how to put a numerical value on the difference between money today and money at a specific time in the future.  We will look at simple and compound interest, present and future value of money, annuities and perpetuities. Understanding the time value of money will help us to make investment decisions or, as corporate finance managers, decisions about whether to buy or sell an entire business or to invest in an advertising campaign. It’s an important skill and will require you to work through financial models that involve some equations and numbers. Knowledge of the time value of money will make you more confident dealing with financial transactions and better understand how the world of finance operates."
270,Valuation of financial securities,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance-know-your-numbers-2,"This week we will consider applying our knowledge of interest rates to some real world problems. We will learn how to estimate the value of an enterprise. We will learn about capital budgeting techniques to help us  decide intelligently which projects that are available to a business should be pursued.The techniques we will learn include Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return,  Pay Back Period, and the Money Multiple Method. We will also discuss briefly the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM, which enables us to estimate the cost of capital for a business, which is the return demanded by the providers of the capital, that is, the investors."
271,Estimating enterprise value,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance-know-your-numbers-2,"In week 4 we extend the valuation tools developed in the course so far to evaluate a series of new business investment opportunities.   We will start off by considering the value of an existing, established business. We have already seen how we can use the traditional Operating Free Cash Flow (OFCF)/Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) model to estimate the Enterprise value of a business.  We will now use an alternate model, the Residual Income model, for the same purpose. Once we are comfortable with the various different business valuation models, we will turn our attention to an assessment of the risk profile of the investment.  We will firstly differentiate between the risks that are being allowed for in the discount rate, or “systematic risks”, and those that are specific to the project being considered, or “idiosyncratic risks”.  Towards the end, we will look at tools that help assess the idiosyncratic risk of the investment. "
272,Application of financial valuation tools ,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance-know-your-numbers-2,"This week, we will apply the valuation tools we have developed in the course so far to improve our existing business.  We start by revisiting the NPV rule for individual project investment decisions, and then extend that to think about how individual projects impact value at the Enterprise level. We then consider a range of specific applications for our project evaluation tools, including capital rationing, asset replacement, and outsourcing decisions. After this we will turn our attention to the question of how well our existing businesses are performing. We will start by introducing a range of performance measurement tools.  This will help us to develop a framework for both recognising how well we are currently performing, and selecting from a series of deliberate choices to improve that performance. "
273,Putting it all together - Applying financial valuation techniques ,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance-know-your-numbers-2,"This week is all about revision. There’s not much new content. We’ll focus on applying the theories to a small example, an imaginary online business, and cover some of the more difficult techniques including annuities, perpetuities, Net Present Value, and how to turn profits into cash flows. "
274,Basics of insight generation,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-intelligence-data-analytics,"Organisations and governments everywhere want to exploit data to predict behaviors and extract valuable real-world insights. Billions of devices and social media conversations are fueling the rate at which humanity is producing data. Therefore, we need more skills to understand data and make our systems, policies and governance models more efficient. In this week, we will highlight the potential of generating insights with the help of data in allowing individuals, businesses, and governments to make effective decisions."

This module focuses on GDP determination in the short run, which is a critical step in understanding macroeconomic fluctuations and the role of stabilization policies. Long-run trends, expectations, and price level movements will be examined in subsequent modules."
362,Module 2: Expectations and the Long-Run Exchange Rate,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/macroeconomic-factors?specialization=managerial-economics-business-analysis,"Where do expectations about the future of economic variables come from? This question is important because expectations matter a great deal in the choices made by economic agents at every point in time. This is quite easy to see in the connection between the exchange rate in the spot market at each moment and the expected exchange rate in the future spot market. In this module, we examine the formation of exchange rate expectations based on a model of long-run equilibrium in the foreign exchange market. The model turns out to be very insightful regarding the factors that drive the real exchange rates and competitiveness of economies over the years."

456,Chapter One - Why we Program?,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,These are the course-wide materials as well as the first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs.  We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course you may want to come back and look at these materials.  This section should not take you an entire week. 
457,Installing and Using Python,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the ""Using Python in this Class"" material for details."
458,Chapter One: Why We Program (continued),7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In the first chapter we try to cover the ""big picture"" of programming so you get a ""table of contents"" of the rest of the book.   Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it.   This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in.  You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters."
459,Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information."
460,Chapter Three: Conditional Code,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.  It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes ""choices""."
461,Chapter Four: Functions,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,"This is a relatively short chapter.   We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code."
462,Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python,Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.  Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over.   Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.
463,Chapter Six: Strings,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"In this class, we pick up where we left off in the previous class, starting in Chapter 6 of the textbook and covering Strings and moving into data structures.   The second week of this class is dedicated to getting Python installed if you want to actually run the applications on your desktop or laptop.  If you choose not to install Python, you can just skip to the third week and get a head start."
464,Unit: Installing and Using Python,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  We do not require installation of Python for this class.  You can write and test Python programs in the browser using the ""Python Code Playground"" in this lesson.  Please read the ""Using Python in this Class"" material for details."
465,Chapter Seven: Files,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"Up to now, we have been working with data that is read from the user or data in constants.   But real programs process much larger amounts of data by reading and writing files on the secondary storage on your computer.   In this chapter we start to write our first programs that read, scan, and process real data.  "
466,Chapter Eight: Lists,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables.  Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable.  Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.  We call these multi-valued variables ""collections"" or ""data structures""."
467,Chapter Nine: Dictionaries,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures.  Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs.  Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory ""database"" in a single Python variable."
468,Chapter Ten: Tuples,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure.  Tuples are a simple version of lists.  We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.
469,Graduation,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python,"To celebrate your making it to the halfway point in our Python for Everybody Specialization, we welcome you to attend our online graduation ceremony.  It is not very long, and it features a Commencement speaker and very short commencement speech."
470,Getting Started,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python,"In this section you will install Python and a text editor.  In previous classes in the specialization this was an optional assignment, but in this class it is the first requirement to get started.

We will discuss the different core elements within those statements following basic accounting principles with the discussion framed in reference to excerpts from the actual financial statements produced by the US-listed food company Kellogg's.
735,An Intuition-based Introduction to Financial Analysis,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-analysis?specialization=learn-finance,"Understanding the importance and the accounting principles underpinning the key financial statements of a company, we now turn our attention to synthesizing and condensing the financial statement information for the purpose of financial analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate how financial analysts use ratio analysis to measure relative profitability, leverage, efficiency and the liquidity of a company. Again, we utilise information from the financial statements of Kellogg's and its competitor Kraft to demonstrate these financial analysis techniques."
736,The Links Between Accounting Principles and Financial Decision-making,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-analysis?specialization=learn-finance,"Having established initial basic financial analyst's toolset in the first two weeks of this course, some caution is warranted as we turn our attention to some of the pitfalls associated with uncritical use of financial statements by analysts. Specifically, we highlight how the use of historical cost and accrual-based accounting might lead to sub-optimal corporate financial decision-making. We then discuss how the agency relationship between management and the owners of a company may also lead to poor corporate decision-making. We conclude with a cautionary tale of misleading accounting practices and the regulator's response to these cases."

Sound financial decision-making by CFOs and investors, requires an assessment of future (uncertain) financial outcomes. DCF analysis allows the financial analyst to extrapolate the financial statement information in a forward-looking manner. The DCF technique provides an objective way in which we can evaluate financial decisions while overcoming many of the shortcomings associated with standard ratio analysis."
738,An Introduction to Key Global Markets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capital-markets?specialization=learn-finance,"We begin this course by exploring the importance of the financial market environment on corporate financial decision-making.

740,Opportunities and Constraints in Global Markets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capital-markets?specialization=learn-finance,"In week 3 we discuss the limits to economic growth imposed by imperfections and inefficiencies in global financial markets. The need for liquidity (and the impact of a lack of liquidity) to guarantee efficient markets has been evident in the recent financial crisis. We also discuss the necessary trust in, and integrity of financial markets. Governments, regulators and rating agencies fulfil an important role to secure trust in the fairness and integrity of markets, but there is also a strong incentive for self regulation of markets."
741,Identifying Links Between Global Markets,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capital-markets?specialization=learn-finance,"In the final week of this course we focus our discussion on the interrelatedness of (global) financial markets.

747,Linking risk with expected return,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/valuation?specialization=learn-finance,This week we differentiate between systematic and unsystematic risk and explain how the expected returns that are reflected in the prices of assets should be linked to only one type of risk. We illustrate how the Capital Asset Pricing Model might be used to link systematic risk with expected return and then discuss the empirical shortcomings of the model. This leads to a description of more advanced models and we conclude with a review of survey evidence that considers the approach taken by finance mangers of large listed firms in practice. 
748,Using financial statement analysis to measure cost of capital,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/valuation?specialization=learn-finance,This week we will explain the logical underpinnings of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital Formula and show how it might be estimated in practice by a firm. We will also consider the many challenges that might be faced in using this approach to estimating hurdle rates and conclude with a warning about the perverse outcomes that might occur if the technique is used in a haphazard manner.
749,Addressing financial reality with real options analysis,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/valuation?specialization=learn-finance,This week we describe how standard NPV analysis might lead to incorrect decisions when we fail to account for the impact of (or upon) firm flexibility. We then describe the three most common types of real options that firms face in practice and then explain how decision trees might be used to arrive at an approximation of the value of the real option that is embedded within a project. We conclude by considering empirical evidence on the take-up of real options analysis and discuss the situations in which real options analysis might most be needed.
