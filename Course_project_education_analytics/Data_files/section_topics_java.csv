35,Welcome and Project Overview: Visualizing Data,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java,"We hope you’re excited about the project that we're starting to build -- we sure are!  In this second part of this week, we'll walk you through setting up your system and working through your first assignment so you'll be having fun with it in no time. Before that though, we'll finish going over some of the fundamentals fundamentals of object oriented programming.  Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. Like the end of last week, the first part of this week might be a bit of a review of material you already learned in your first Java programming course.  If that’s the case, you are always welcome to skip to the first graded assignment on Objects, Memory Models, and Scope."
36,"Memory Models, Scope, and Starting the Project",6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java,"Now that you have the tools to write and trace object oriented code, let’s get back to developing the project! In this first (real) part of the project, you will create an interactive graphical map that will display geospatial data. This is a highly interactive week, so make sure you’ve got Eclipse loaded up!  We encourage you to play around as you watch the videos.  Some of the code that we use in the videos is in the demos package in the starter code you set up for this course.  Open it up and experiment with it while you're watching the videos.  We also encourage you to dive right into the programming project, even before watching the videos, if you want.  The programming assignment instructions are in the last lesson of this week - you can watch a video walkthrough of the instructions and also read the step-by-step directions in the accompanying reading. There’s lots of room for creativity, too, so have fun!"
37,Graphical output: Creating GUIs and Displaying Data,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java,"Now that you’re in full swing with the project, let’s take a closer look at some concepts that you have already been using in your code.  Specifically, the keyword “extends”.  What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism.  These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future!  We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently.  If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this week.  As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.    "
38,Inheritance,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java,"You’ve reached an exciting point in the project - in this week you’ll add interactivity to your map!  You’ll be learning how to design event-driven programs, using a new and powerful programming paradigm.  Your map will now respond to mouse hovers and clicks.

In this last module we'll shift gears a bit to talk about some very exciting and fundamental algorithms for finding and sorting data in an array.  Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here.  We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us.

In the first lesson you'll learn about Strings and Regular Expressions, and in the programming assignment this week you'll apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the ""readability"" of text by calculating something called the ""Flesch Readability Score"".  This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly.  So, let's get started building some code!"
42,Working with Strings,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"Welcome to week 3!  The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice. "
43,Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"This week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer."

We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries.  You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!  You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now.  :)"
45,Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries),6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance,"You made it to the last week!  Congratulations on getting this far!  In this last week we'll be looking at a fundamental data structure called a Hash Table.  If you thought trees were fast, just wait until you see what Hash Tables can do!   Your last programming assignment will add spelling correction suggestions to your text editor, and there's an optional assignment that builds on the same ideas as the main assignment too, if you have the time and energy.

We'll also apply sorting to your project, and you'll wrap things up by finishing your project with an extension of your own choosing."

53,Introduction to the Course,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we're going to dive into the course programming project.  In the first lesson you'll learn about Strings and Regular Expressions, and in the programming assignment this week you'll apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the ""readability"" of text by calculating something called the ""Flesch Readability Score"".  This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly.  So, let's get started building some code!"
54,Working with Strings,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"Welcome to week 3!  The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice. "
55,Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented,"This week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer."

You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!

In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments.  But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer.  This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine.  We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph.  Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search.  Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes.   Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine!"
61,Class design and simple graph search,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"In the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map.  In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a ""weighted graph"".  Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs.  To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.  In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another."
62,Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented,"In this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning.  For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve ""hard"" problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms.  We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!  "

You’ll recognize these problems as “classic” interview problems you’ve probably heard a lot about, designed to test your problem solving skills as well as your analysis and coding abilities.  Don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to approach them with confidence through a 6-step process to addressing technical questions (hint: you don’t have to produce the perfect solution on the first try!).

77,Welcome to the Course!,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn the fundamentals of task parallelism. Tasks are the most basic unit of parallel programming. An increasing number of programming languages (including Java and C++) are moving from older thread-based approaches to more modern task-based approaches for parallel programming. We will learn about task creation, task termination, and the “computation graph” theoretical model for understanding various properties of task-parallel programs.  These properties include work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, and Amdahl’s Law. We will also learn popular Java APIs for task parallelism, most notably the Fork/Join framework."
78,Task Parallelism,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java,"Welcome to Module 2!  In this module, we will learn about approaches to parallelism that have been inspired by functional programming.  Advocates of parallel functional programming have argued for decades that functional parallelism can eliminate many hard-to-detect bugs that can occur with imperative parallelism.  We will learn about futures, memoization, and streams, as well as data races, a notorious class of bugs that can be avoided with functional parallelism.  We will also learn Java APIs for functional parallelism, including the Fork/Join framework and the Stream API’s."

It is well known that many applications spend a majority of their execution time in loops, so there is a strong motivation to learn how loops can be sped up through the use of parallelism, which is the focus of this module.  We will start by learning how parallel counted-for loops can be conveniently expressed using forall and stream APIs in Java, and how these APIs can be used to parallelize a simple matrix multiplication program.  We will also learn about the barrier construct for parallel loops, and illustrate its use with a simple iterative averaging program example.  Finally, we will learn the importance of grouping/chunking parallel iterations to reduce overhead."
81,Loop Parallelism,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java,"Welcome to the last module of the course!  In this module, we will wrap up our introduction to parallel programming by learning how data flow principles can be used to increase the amount of parallelism in a program.  We will learn how Java’s Phaser API can be used to implement “fuzzy” barriers, and also “point-to-point” synchronizations as an optimization of regular barriers by revisiting the iterative averaging example.  Finally, we will also learn how pipeline parallelism and data flow models can be expressed using Java APIs.  "

84,Welcome to the Course!,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn about threads and locks, which have served as primitive building blocks for concurrent programming for over five decades.  All computing platforms today include some form of support for threads and locks, and make them available for use by developers in a wide range of programming languages. We will learn how threads can be created, joined, and synchronized using structured (e.g., synchronized statements/methods) and unstructured (e.g., java.util.concurrent libraries) locks in Java.  We will also learn about new classes of bugs that can arise when concurrent programs need to access shared resources.  These bugs are referred to as violations of liveness/progress guarantees, and include deadlock, livelock, and starvation.  We will conclude this module by studying different solutions to the classical ""Dining Philosophers"" problem, and use these solutions to illustrate instances of deadlock, livelock and starvation."
85,Threads and Locks,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn different approaches to coordinating accesses to shared resources without encountering the deadlock or livelock bugs studied earlier.  Critical/isolated sections are higher-level concurrent programming constructs (relative to locks) that simplify the implementation of mutual exclusion by guaranteeing the absence of deadlocks and livelocks.  Object-based isolation relaxes the constraints imposed by critical sections by allowing mutual exclusion to be specified on a per-object basis, as illustrated in the Spanning Tree example.  Java's atomic variables represent an important, but restricted, case of object-based isolation that is implemented efficiently on all hardware platforms.  Finally, we will learn how object-based isolation can be further relaxed with read/write access modes."

87,Talking to Two Sigma: Using it in the Field,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn another high-level approach to concurrent programming called the ""Actor"" model.  A major difference between the Actor model and the Isolated Sections model is that there are no data races possible in the Actor model because it does not allow for any form of shared variables.  However, as in all concurrent programming models, higher-level forms of nondeterminism are still possible in the Actor model due to an inherent asynchrony in the order in which messages may be delivered.  We will study multiple examples of concurrency using the Actor model, including the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers, as well as producer-consumer patterns with both unbounded and bounded buffers."
88,Actors,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/concurrent-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will study Concurrent Data Structures, which form an essential software layer in all multithreaded programming systems.  First, we will learn about Optimistic Concurrency, an important multithreaded pattern in which two threads can ""optimistically"" make progress on their assigned work without worrying about mutual conflicts, and only checking for conflicts before ""committing"" the results of their work.  We will then study the widely-used Concurrent Queue data structure.  Even though the APIs for using concurrent queues are very simple, their implementations using the Optimistic Concurrency model can be complex and error-prone.   To that end, we will also learn the formal notion of Linearizability to better understand correctness requirements for concurrent data structures.  We will then study Concurrent Hash Maps, another widely-used concurrent data structure.  Finally, we discuss a concurrent algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree of an undirected graph, an algorithm that relies on the use of Concurrent Data Structures under the covers."

91,Welcome to the Course!,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn about the MapReduce paradigm, and how it can be used to write distributed programs that analyze data represented as key-value pairs.  A MapReduce program is defined via user-specified map and reduce functions, and we will learn how to write such programs in the Apache Hadoop and Spark projects.  TheMapReduce paradigm can be used to express a wide range of parallel algorithms.  One example that we will study is computation of the TermFrequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) statistic used in document mining; this algorithm uses a fixed (non-iterative) number of map and reduce operations.  Another MapReduce example that we will study is parallelization of the PageRank algorithm.  This algorithm is an example of iterative MapReduce computations, and is also the focus of the mini-project associated with this module."
92,DISTRIBUTED MAP REDUCE,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn about client-server programming, and how distributed Java applications can communicate with each other using sockets.  Since communication via sockets occurs at the level of bytes, we will learn how to serialize objects into bytes in the sender process and to deserialize bytes into objects in the receiver process. Sockets and serialization provide the necessary background for theFile Server mini-project associated with this module.  We will also learn about Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which extends the notion of method invocation in a sequential program to a distributed programming setting.  Likewise, we will learn about multicast sockets,which generalize the standard socket interface to enable a sender to send the same message to a specified set of receivers; this capability can be very useful for a number of applications, including news feeds,video conferencing, and multi-player games.  Finally, we will learn about distributed publish-subscribe applications, and how they can be implemented using the Apache Kafka framework."

94,Talking to Two Sigma: Using it in the Field,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will learn how to write distributed applications in the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model, specifically by using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.  MPI processes can send and receive messages using primitives for point-to-point communication, which are different in structure and semantics from message-passing with sockets.  We will also learn about the message ordering and deadlock properties of MPI programs.  Non-blocking communications are an interesting extension of point-to-point communications, since they can be used to avoid delays due to blocking and to also avoid deadlock-related errors.  Finally, we will study collective communication, which can involve multiple processes in a manner that is more powerful than multicast and publish-subscribe operations.  The knowledge of MPI gained in this module will be put to practice in the mini-project associated with this module on implementing a distributed matrix multiplication program in MPI."
95,MESSAGE PASSING,7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java,"In this module, we will study the roles of processes and threads as basic building blocks of parallel, concurrent, and distributed Java programs.  With this background, we will then learn how to implement multithreaded servers for increased responsiveness in distributed applications written using sockets, and apply this knowledge in the mini-project on implementing a parallel file server using both multithreading and sockets.  An analogous approach can also be used to combine MPI and multithreading, so as to improve the performance of distributed MPI applications.  Distributed actors serve as yet another example of combining distribution and multithreading.  A notable property of the actor model is that the same high-level constructs can be used to communicate among actors running in the same process and among actors in different processes; the difference between the two cases depends on the application configuration, rather the application code.  Finally, we will learn about the reactive programming model,and its suitability for implementing distributed service oriented architectures using asynchronous events."

Midway through the module, you’ll take a break from ""theory"" and install the Go programming environment on your computer. At the end of the module, you'll write a simple program that displays “Hello, World” on your screen."
204,Module 1: Getting Started with Go,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started,"Now that you’ve set up your programming environment and written a test program, you’re ready to dive into data types.

216,Programming Challenges,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will learn about seemingly naïve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges."
217,Algorithmic Warm-up,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using naïve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!"
218,Greedy Algorithms,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text. "

222,Basic Data Structures,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"We start this module by considering priority queues which are used to efficiently schedule jobs, either in the context of a computer operating system or in real life, to sort huge files, which is the most important building block for any Big Data processing algorithm, and to efficiently compute shortest paths in graphs, which is a topic we will cover in our next course. For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient. By completing this module, you will be able to implement both these data structures efficiently from scratch."
223,Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will learn about very powerful and widely used technique called hashing. Its applications include implementation of programming languages, file systems, pattern search, distributed key-value storage and many more. You will learn how to implement data structures to store and modify sets of objects and mappings from one type of objects to another one. You will see that naive implementations either consume huge amount of memory or are slow, and then you will learn to implement hash tables that use linear memory and work in O(1) on average! In the end, you will learn how hash functions are used in modern disrtibuted systems and how they are used to optimize storage of services like Dropbox, Google Drive and Yandex Disk!"
224,Priority Queues and Disjoint Sets,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets. You will learn about many of the difficulties in accomplishing this task and the ways in which we can overcome them. In order to do this you will need to learn the basic structure of binary search trees, how to insert and delete without destroying this structure, and how to ensure that the tree remains balanced."
225,Hash Tables,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,In this module we continue studying binary search trees. We study a few non-trivial applications. We then study the new kind of balanced search trees - Splay Trees. They adapt to the queries dynamically and are optimal in many ways.

228,Decomposition of Graphs 1,6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs?specialization=data-structures-algorithms,"In this module you will study algorithms for finding Shortest Paths in Graphs. These algorithms have lots of applications. When you launch a navigation app on your smartphone like Google Maps or Yandex.Navi, it uses these algorithms to find you the fastest route from work to home, from home to school, etc. When you search for airplane tickets, these algorithms are used to find a route with the minimum number of plane changes. Unexpectedly, these algorithms can also be used to determine the optimal way to do currency exchange, sometimes allowing to earh huge profit! We will cover all these applications, and you will learn Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm. These algorithms are efficient and lay the foundation for even more efficient algorithms which you will learn and implement in the Shortest Paths Capstone Project to find best routes on real maps of cities and countries, find distances between people in Social Networks. In the end you will be able to find Shortest Paths efficiently in any Graph. This week we will study Breadth-First Search algorithm."

However, some of the results Pavel mentioned remain mysterious: e.g., how can we perform exact pattern matching in O(|Text|) time rather than in O(|Text|*|Pattern|) time as in the naïve brute force algorithm? How can it be that matching a 1000-nucleotide pattern against the human genome is nearly as fast as matching a 3-nucleotide pattern??? Also, even though Pavel showed how to quickly construct the suffix array given the suffix tree, he has not revealed the magic behind the fast algorithms for the suffix tree construction!In this module, Miсhael will address some algorithmic challenges that Pavel tried to hide from you :) such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for exact pattern matching and more efficient algorithms for suffix tree and suffix array construction."

345,Week One,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/html?specialization=web-design,"This week you will need to take a deep breath and jump into coding.  I will cover a large number of HTML tags, but it is important that you do more than just listen to these video and read the text book material.  You need to practice (and fail!) in order to learn.     Believe it or not, once you master the basic idea of using tags and attributes you will know everything you need to use any HTML5 tag.  The page may not look the way you want it to look yet, but you will be able to  use text, links, images, tables, and even music and videos!    If you want to refer to a textbook this week for reinforcement of concepts, we will be using the Shay Howe online textbook as a reference.  I will include links after the lectures, but some students prefer to read before the videos.  (My preferred approach is to read/watch/read again.)"
346,Week Two,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/html?specialization=web-design,"Okay, you created a file...what now?

In particular we will talk about the Box Model, background images, opacity, float, columns, visibility, and designing for different browsers."
349,Week Two: Advanced Styling,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introcss?specialization=web-design,"Have you ever noticed on a web page that some links are blue and others are purple, depending upon if you have clicked on the links?  How is it possible to style some anchor tags and not others?  This week you will learn how to style pseudo-classes (e.g. a link that has been visiting, an element that has the mouse hovering over it) and pseudo-elements (e.g. the first-letter of a heading, the first line of a paragraph).  These elements are not difficult to style, but do require careful coding.  It is also the first step to adding simple animation to your site.  We end this week with the subject of positioning -- how to get elements to stick to a certain part of your page.  Think about annoying pop-up ads.  How do the programmers get them to stay RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN despite the fact that you keep trying to scroll them away."
350,"Week Three:  Psuedo-classes, Pseudo-elements, Transitions, and Positioning",5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introcss?specialization=web-design,"This week I am going to do some code review.

353,Week One: Introduction to JavaScript,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript?specialization=web-design,"If you have written HTML code in the past, hopefully you have fallen into the great habit of validating your code -- making sure that you close all of your open tags.  There are other rules that you may or may not have been following as well, for instance the importance of using each id attribute only once per page. This is called writing ""clean"" code.  The reasoning and importance of following these rules becomes clear as we begin to manipulate the different components of your webpage based on the the actions of the person interacting with your page.  In particular you will learn about the JavaScript Mouse Events and Touch Events.  This week's materials will end with a photo gallery example that you can create along with me."

We’ll start out with the larger questions of content, context and audience that frame any UI/UX project. In other words: What is it? Who is it for? And, where does it live? And we’ll look at the big picture of overall design direction, what is often referred to as “look and feel”. From there we’ll go into detail of how the basic components of how visual design works in the context of interface design: language, shape, color, imagery, typography, and icons. These areas will be the formal building blocks you will use to create the more complex visual structure of a screen-based user interface. "
641,Formal Elements of Interface Design,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-elements-user-interface-design,"This week we are going to take our static interface elements and begin to think about how a user interacts with them. In other words, how to bring these elements a stage closer to having a life on the screen. We’ll be looking at navigational conventions, such as menus, buttons, and icons in different states. Our focus will move from what the graphic interface looks like, to include how it works and how it responds to the user. By adding interactivity to our static designs, the idea is to think more deeply about the role the designer plays in shaping a user’s interactive experience."
642,Active Elements of Interface Design,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-elements-user-interface-design,"This week we are going to take our individual interface components and see what happens when we try to put them together into a more complex structure. We’ll be looking at how to get our components to work harmoniously as a family, figuring out how hierarchy works in the interface, and discussing conventions and expectations of contemporary interface design. We’ll also be examining how to navigate to different screens and how to build visual relationships between different kinds of content within a single site. Finally, we’ll be discussing different platforms, how to create variable content for different screen sizes, and looking at how to organize complex bodies of content into user-friendly structures."

644,Course Overview,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"Your assignment at the end of this week is the first stage in a multi-step process towards developing a clickable prototype: coming up with a clearly articulated idea for an app with a specific goal in mind. So this week we will focus on how to articulate and structure your ideas and goals, how to use naming and language as a part of your app’s identity. We will also look at audience research and user centered design."
645,"Ideation, Articulation, Development",5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"This week we’re going to continue to develop, plan, and test your app idea. We’ll start by sketching out more extensive content and mapping it into a structure. To test what aspects of your app are working, we’ll look at how to create a non-visual paper prototype and work our way towards a sitemap. While you’re developing the logic of your app, you’ll also begin to develop the look and feel of it: the visual development process."
646,"Planning, Testing, Researching, Mapping",5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"At this stage in our process we are going to take our site map, look and feel research, and user testing to the next level in order to get a more accurate static prototype. By building a wireframe of our interface, we’ll figure out what goes where, and on which pages, utilizing our user testing information to figure out the hierarchy and structure of our app. This week is about the logic and functionality of our interface, and how it’s actually going to work within the app."
647,What Goes Where?,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals,"In this final week of the course, you will be taking your wireframes or app screens and make a simple functioning digital prototype to simulate the experience of interactivity. We’ll be using simple prototyping software to put your static screens into a realistic context, and simulating interaction in order to understand how your app feels, in order to troubleshoot and fix problems. This is the part of the course where all your talents come together! For me this is the most exciting part of UI/UX development, when it all starts to become real and you have a believable prototype in your hands. "

649,Course Overview,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-strategy,"This week I will give you a brief overview of the user experience process that I will teach in this course sequence. We will begin by defining the term ""user experience"", and then briefly look at the five phases of UX design: Strategy, Outline of Scope, Sitemap, Wireframes, and Visual Mockups. I will also talk about the differences between mobile apps and websites, and the differences between waterfall and agile approaches to UX design. Lastly, I will introduce you to the main project that you will be working on in this course and the one that follows it. You’ll be starting your first assignment at the end of the week. Last, here's something to keep in mind this week: “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”—Steve Jobs"
650,The User Experience Process,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-strategy,"This week is all about strategy. We will talk about how to conduct research in the beginning of a project. And I will tell you about the importance of defining a target audience for your website. We’ll also discuss how to determine user needs and client needs. The strategy that you develop in this first step in the UX process will influence all decisions you make further down the line. That’s why it’s so important to take the time and think about what you want to accomplish, what the goals are, and how they might be measured when the project launches. "
651,Asking Good Questions: Determining Strategy,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-strategy,"By now you should have a pretty clear idea what your projects will be about and who your target audience is. This week we will talk about how to take the user and client needs that you have established and create a set of content and functionality requirements from them. In other words, you’re transforming your overarching goals from last week into specific requirements for your site."
652,What is in and What is Out: Outlining Scope,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-strategy,"Welcome to the last week of this course. With your outline of scope in hand, you will now learn how to transform the content and functionality requirements determined last week into a navigable structure. This structure will be visualized by something called a sitemap. I’ll tell you all about sitemaps and how to create them. Along the way we will also define the term ""information architecture"". And I will introduce a tool called TreeJack, which will enable you to test your site map on actual users."

654,Course Overview,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"This week is all about wireframes. After mapping out our strategy and scope in the previous course, Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture, this is the first time in the process that we will address the screen. Now things are going to get much more concrete as we’re starting to actually lay out elements for the user interface. This week you will learn why working on wireframes first—before designing high-fidelity mockups—is a helpful intermediate step. I’ll also talk about responsive design, navigation systems, wayfinding, common design patterns, and strategies for homepage design. And, we’ll discuss which tools are most appropriate for creating wireframes. Because creating those will be your assignment at the end of the week. "
655,Not Getting Caught up in the Details: Wireframes,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"We finally reached the point that many of you—especially if you consider yourself a visual designer—have probably been waiting for. We’ll now talk about designing the look and feel for your website. Meaning, we’re ready to design visual mockups. Finally, you’ll get to decide on colors, typefaces, and images. Maybe you’ll create a few illustrations. And your site will need a logo, too. This week, we’ll focus on designing the visual mockups of just the homepage. To find some inspiration, I’ll also have you create a mood board."
656,"Finally, Make it Beautiful: The Mockup Phase",5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"This week, you’ll continue the visual design of your websites, refining the look and feel based on peer feedback. Having worked on the homepage mockup last week, it’s time to design the remaining screens. As an important aside, I will take you on a short expedition to the land of code. Although this specialization isn’t about learning how to code, I want to at least introduce you to the technologies that make the web work. And we’ll look at a few coding examples. After all, the web is built upon certain languages—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  in order to be an effective UX designer, it is helpful to have a rudimentary understanding of these technologies. "
657,An Excursion to Codelandia,5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-wireframes-prototypes,"Welcome to the final week of this course and the final week of the entire UI/UX Design Specialization. I hope that you learned a lot of new concepts, techniques, and skills that will allow you to design some amazing interactive experiences in the real world. This week, you will have time to revise any of your project components. And then I’d like you to assemble them into a presentation that will represent the culmination of all of the UX phases we covered. This should be a great project to include in your portfolio. I’ll also show you how to take your static mockups and assemble them into clickable prototypes.  "

680,Image Classification In the Browser,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow,"This week we'll see how to take models that have been created with TensorFlow in Python and convert them to JSON format so that they can run in the browser using Javascript. We will start by looking at two models that have already been pre-converted. One of them is going to be a toxicity classifier, which uses NLP to determine if a phrase is toxic in a number of categories; the other one is Mobilenet which can be used to detect content in images.

You also learned about the standalone TensorFlow Lite Interpreter which could be used to test these models. You wrapped with an exercise that converted a Fashion MNIST based model to TensorFlow Lite and then tested it with the interpreter.This week you'll look at the first of the deployment types for this course: Android. Android is a versatile operating system that is used in a number of different device type, but most commonly phones, tablets and TV systems. Using TensorFlow Lite you can run your models on Android, so you can bring ML to any of these device types. 

While it helps to understand some Android programming concepts, we hope that you'll be able to follow along even if you don't, and at the very least try out the full sample apps that we'll explore for Image Classification, Object Detection and more!"

685,Building the TensorFLow model on IOS,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/device-based-models-tensorflow,"Now that you've looked at TensorFlow Lite and explored building apps on Android and iOS that use it, the next and final step is to explore embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, and learn how to get your models running on that. The nice thing is that the Pi is a full Linux system, so it can run Python, allowing you to either use the full TensorFlow for Training and Inference, or just the Interpreter for Inference. I'd recommend the latter, as training on a Pi can be slow!"

695,Introduction,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-computer-interaction?specialization=interaction-design,"This module’s videos and assignment cover a really important topic: where can you get good design ideas from? Ideas that help you create meaningful designs that have a real impact on real people’s lives. Of course, good ideas come from lots of places. And wherever they come from, great. There are a few strategies I’ve found that are especially valuable, and that’s what we cover in this module’s videos. Given our focus on *real* people, we focus on going out, watching what people do, and talking to them. Check out the first video, describing participant observation. Combining observation with interviewing (the second video) provides a powerful foundation for needfinding and brainstorming.So what happens after you’ve observed a lot of stuff -- how do you connect the high-level needs to concrete design ideas? To help you bridge this gap, this module closes with a video on Creating Design Goals."
696,Needfinding,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-computer-interaction?specialization=interaction-design,"This module's lectures introduce storyboarding and several strategies and media for rapid prototyping, including paper, Wizard of Oz Prototyping, and video.  An important part of the creativity of a designer is to think about how you can rapidly prototype and get feedback on your ideas. Because it's almost never the case that the first idea you have will be the best. As a designer, you can learn the most when you're creating and getting feedback on multiple alternatives. Your work will nearly always benefit from thinking broadly to find the right design, and then from lots of polish to get the design right. Prototyping is also a great way to achieve common ground across the design team and other stakeholders. We begin with storyboards, paper prototyping and mockups. Students often ask about the relationship between needfinding and prototyping: how closely does one flow into the other? Ultimately the quality of your final design is the real measure and there are lots of ways to get there. While most design work benefits from prototypes directly informed by the needfinding process, it's not required. This module seeks to introduce you to doing human-centered design, and walk you through one path that such an approach could take. In both this Specialization and in real life, you are welcome to revise your ideas as much as you like. "
697,Rapid Prototyping: Wizard of Oz Prototyping,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-computer-interaction?specialization=interaction-design,"With this module's videos, we turn our focus from brainstorming and prototyping to the concrete elements of interaction design. We introduce ten key principles of good design  -- like the importance of feedback and helping people recover from errors. We call these heuristics -- watch the first video here. I hope you'll find these heuristics practical and applicable to your work both inside and outside class. The lectures discuss these heuristics with a bunch of examples drawn from real-world designs. The goal is to illustrate the many ways that designs can be successful or run into trouble.  While heuristic evaluations (HEs) focus on issues that lead to improvement they can also identify areas we think show successful compliance with a heuristic"
698,Heuristic Evaluation,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-computer-interaction?specialization=interaction-design,"UC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report. Innovation is central to who we are and what we do. Here, students learn that knowledge isn't just acquired in the classroom—life is their laboratory."
699,Welcome and Course Overview,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-principles?specialization=interaction-design,"Our lecture videos in this module begin with the major innovation of the graphical interface: enabling people to perform input directly on top of output. This directness makes interfaces easier to learn because it enables people to recognize familiar elements. And continuous feedback makes interfaces easier to use, encourages exploration, and prevents errors. To illustrate the benefits of direct manipulation in real interfaces, the videos provide several examples of both particular designs and interface styles. I find that's a lot more useful than just stating abstract principles. Now is a good time to remind everyone that I am not endorsing (or rejecting) any particular product, organization, or person. What I am doing: real people in the real world make real design decisions -- you can learn from this -- and in this course I'll discuss these concrete examples so you can gain real knowledge. The rest of the videos will cover topics related to the importance of representations, such as understanding a user's mental model and helping people to distribute cognition. I will show some examples of how representational differences can impact performance. As you watch these videos, think about how you have arranged or lamented representations in your everyday life. Maybe you put your keys by the door, sunglasses on your hat, or a post-it on your laptop? You'll get a chance to delve into these examples in the assignment."
700,Direct Manipulation and Representations,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-principles?specialization=interaction-design,"So far, many examples in our videos have been physical. I like physical examples because they’re often easier to understand, and they durably express fundamental principles. Equipped with those fundamentals, we'll now focus more on concrete issues in interaction design to help you flesh out your interactive prototypes. This module’s videos introduce visual and information design. These are the nuts and bolts of user interfaces: scale, contrast, pattern, shape, color, typography, and layout. What I hope you'll take away from these lectures is a newfound appreciation for how subtle changes in this visual variables can powerfully impact people's experience of documents and interfaces. Dive into the first visual design lecture here. Visual design organizes the world of information. As this module’s lectures show, that visual organization provides important cues, yet the structure itself is often invisible."
701,Visual Design and Information Design,4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-principles?specialization=interaction-design,"After you’ve made a design, how do you know whether it is good? Or if your team has a couple ideas it is considering, how do you know which one is better? Rather than arguing, throwing chairs, or playing rochambeau, we suggest getting your designs in front of real users to see how well they actually work. To enable you to do this, our final module of lectures will introduce you to designing, running, and analyzing experiments. Testing your ideas with people and using what you learn to make them better can often mean the difference between a flop and a hit. Usability testing also gives you a chance to flex your rapid prototyping muscles. Build several interfaces quickly, try them out with people, and use what you learn to revise them. Through repeated iteration and testing, you can end up with a wonderfully polished interface. For me, the most exhilarating aspect of running experiments is the element of surprise. Nearly every time my students, colleagues, and I run a study, we learn something that we never even thought to think of. Sometimes, it's a roadblock or bug. Other times, it's an unexpected new use of a system -- many great startups have emerged out of finding unexpected new uses for technology. Either way, it'll give you new fodder for design. As in the prototyping lectures, the evaluation lectures emphasize comparison -- testing multiple ideas. In many ways, design is choice, and comparing multiple interfaces helps you make good choices. Learn more about designing studies here."

703,Connecting People through Technology,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-computing?specialization=interaction-design,"In our always-on, pervasively connected world, it can seem as if space and distance don’t matter anymore. Indeed, more and more organizations are outsourcing work around the globe and/or opening satellite locations. But being instantly reachable from anywhere in the world, isn’t the same as being there. In this module, you’ll learn the ways that distance does and doesn’t matter, how to design for this reality and how to create technologies that go beyond being there. "
704,Challenges & Opportunities of Collaboration Online,3,https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-computing?specialization=interaction-design,"It can’t possibly work, can it? Slice up challenging problems into tiny pieces, distribute them to people all over the planet, and then gather their responses to piece together a solution. In this module, you’ll learn both the possibilities and limits of crowdsourcing. You’ll learn strategies for being able to use crowdsourcing successfully, and even hear from the voice of a professional crowdworker about what makes it successful from a worker’s perspective.

But it is also good to know what goes into starting a company even if you're not the one doing it. Often times, as an employee, it can feel pretty arbitrary why a company makes the decisions it does (and sometimes it is, but for the sake of argument, we'll assume that the person at the helm of the company isn't just making random decisions). But, often there is a logic there and understanding why a company does what it does is often rooted in the logics that we will be discussing here."
