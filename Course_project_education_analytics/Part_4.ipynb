The demand could come from the job requirement, and their own interest. Students may come from different department who are interest on data science and excited to find a career related to data science. They may not have suffcient technical skill, and management skill to fit the requirement of data scientist jobs. Therefore, this recommender system bring a insight of helping student make up their missing skills, and gain competitiveness in data science field.  \n","\n","For example, if a student want to find a job name data engieer.
