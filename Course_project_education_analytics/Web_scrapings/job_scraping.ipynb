       "\"What is data science and how can you use it to strengthen your organization? This course will teach you about the skills you need on your data team, and how you can structure that team to meet your organization's needs. Data is everywhere! This course will provide you with an understanding of data sources your company can use and how to store that data. You'll also discover ways to analyze and visualize your data through dashboards and A/B tests. To wrap up the course, we'll discuss exciting topics in machine learning, including clustering, time series prediction, natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and explainable AI! Along the way, you'll learn about a variety of real-world applications of data science and gain a better understanding of these concepts through practical exercises.\""
