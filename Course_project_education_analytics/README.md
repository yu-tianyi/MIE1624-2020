# Course Project: Education Analytics

### Background
Data science, analytics, AI, big data are becoming widely used in many fields, that leads to the ever-increasing demand of data analysts, data scientists and other data professionals. Due to that, data science education is now a hot topic for educators and entrepreneurs.

In this project, your team will first re-design the course curriculum for “MIE1624: Introduction to Data Science and Analytics” course at University of Toronto, such that students acquire an introduction to the most relevant topics and skills in data science and AI. Second, your team will need to design a curriculum for a new “Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” program at University of Toronto with focus not only on technical but also on business and soft skills, see, e.g., http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Degrees/MastersPrograms/MMA, http://smith.queensu.ca/grad_studies/mmai/, http://mbai.kse.ua, or http://schulich.yorku.ca/programs/mmai/, that contains optimal courses (and internships, projects, extra-curricular activities, etc.) for students to obtain necessary technical and business skills to pursue a successful career as data scientist, analytics and data manager, data analyst, business analyst, AI system designer, etc. Third, your team will need to develop your own analytics-based solution in education field, examples of ideas can be found below, but you are not limited to those.

### Learning Objectives
1. Develop the ability to work in a team on a consulting project. (You are required to work on the project in the same group as for your in-class presentation. Check the Quercus portal for the list of your group members.)

2.  Improve on skills and competencies required for performing a full cycle of data science and analytics workflow, i.e., data collection and pre-processing, applying algorithms to analyze data, trend identification, storytelling based on analytics (writing a consulting report and delivering an oral presentation).
